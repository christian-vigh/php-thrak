Bringing Africa SO""'th 
YESTERDA Y'S Novel 
Ford  Premier  League  en­counter  
at  the  Katutura Stadium  
ended  with 
refe­
ree  IsbosethKandjii hav­
ing to flee the field flanked 
by policemen  after  Tigers players  
and  supporters 
at­
tacked  him.  . The  
match.  featuring 
Black Africa and Mukorob Tigers.  
brought 
joy to Black  
Africa  players. officials  
and  fans  but  it 
will be a day  that  referee 
will want  to  forget. The  
trouble  started 
af­
ter  a hat-trick by super 
substitute Smithley  Engel­
brecht,  who  steered  Black Africa  
to  a 
3-0 victory. Kandjii  
had  to  be 
es­
corted  away  in  a  police van  
after  being  ' attacked by Tigers  supporters  and players  
after  the  final whistle.  
The  
mob  protested  that the  
referee  had  handled 
the match unfairly and  also accused  
the  whistleman 
of being drunk:. 
Spatking the troUble was Tigers  
player-coach 
Dan­
Boy  Ndjadila.  who  spoiled an  
afternoon  in  which  he otherwise  
displayed 
ex­
cellent form in Tigers' midfield. Ndjadila  
lost  his  cool and  
punched  the  referee. causing 
all hell  to  break loose 
as the Ingweinyama supporters  
invaded  the field  
and  cornered  the referee. Fists  
and  boots  flew leaving  
the  poor  referee running  
and  ducking  to avoid  
further  harm. 
The police, who  seemed to  
have  been  expecting the  
trouble,  moved  in swiftly  
and  Kandjii  was escorted  
to safety 
but not before  
he 
had received  a blow  
with  a  stick  from another  
angry  supporter. 
It was  also bad timing for  
Tigers  who  only 
dew 
months  ago  made  the 
headlines by becoming the 
first  local  club  to launch  a Code.of  
Conduct  for  their 
Supporters Club. This 
initiative  was  taken  after

told  the

Na­

the  reintegration 
of

"slow but  on course". 
He  called  on  Walvis Bay 
residents  to  welcome  and accept  
change.  Namibia

normal  relations  while the

the  two  countries, it

South African  Foreign Minister 
Pik Botha  and 
Gurirab announced in Wind­

and  Namibia  would establish  
the  JAA  
to  control the  
enclave. "Change will  come.  Why fight  
the 
inevitable?"" he asked. 
.' 
Namibia  saw  the intro­
duction of the  JAA  as "an 
interim  arrangement". 
"The issue  is not  the  joint administration

Confident  Zaire  lead  the  way 
NAIROBI: Zaire,  displaying  more  confidence  than the 
host,  beat Kenya 3-1 in a Group  4 Africa Cup of Nations 
match in Nrurobi on Saturday . Zaire's first  goal came in the 
32nd minute  and  the  third in the  57th  minute.  Kenya, which 
played mostly  a defensive  game,  scored in the 55th minute. Zaire 
now leads  Group  4 with  four  points  from two matches.

Strauss inspires  Western  Province 
CAPE TOWN: Western  Province,  thanks  to iqspired lead­
ership by Tiaan  Strauss,  finished  fourth on the Bankfui 
Currie .Cup  log  when  they beat Free State .29-23  at New­
lands on Saturday. . 
The home side led 12-9  at  halftime and scored three goals,  
a 
try and a penalty  goal  to  their  opponents two goals and  
three  penalty  goals. 
The national  selectors made a bad mistake when they ommitted  
Strauss,  the  Western  Province 
eighthman and 
captain, from their  Springbok iine~up ag~nst the  Walla-
bies. · ... 
He dotted down once and had a hand in two · 'other  tries ' .. 
With·Province trailing  23-22 and with only  three minutes 
rem  aining  he put in another  strong  run and hadErich Lubbe 
(centre) in support who gave  to  Kobus Burger left wing~ 
who  dotted down. 
Western  Province owed much of their  success  to  the excellent ball  
secured 
by Strauss and his fellow loosefor­
wards  F C  Srn  it and An~w Aitken in the  rucks and mauls.

wizard,  however,  declined to  
comment  on  his  team's chances  
for  league  honours saying  
that  his  players  would  do  
the  talking  on  the 
play­
ing  field. 
"It's still  too  early  to  talk about  
the  league  honours now. 
We are  playing  well  at this  
stage,  but  it  does  not automatically  
crown  us  for the  
championships," 
the soft­
spoken  Ngubane  said. Liverpool  
are  now  tipped as  
favourites  to  clinch  the league  
title  after  Pupkewitz Toyota  
Young 
Ones failed to  
record  a win  in both  their away  
outings  at  the 
week­
end. Young 
Ones played  to  a goalless  
stalemate  against 
TCL Chief Santos at 
Nomtsoub  on  Saturday  and . 
continued 
their goal  drought against  
Robber  Chanties  at Outjo  
yesterday. 
It is,  however,  uncertain who  
is in  the  lead  between Liverpool  
and  Young  Ones, as  
the 
Premier League  is still  
not  in a position  to draw  up  
an  updated  league  table.

Civics  yesterday  and most  
certainly  restored  the defending  
champion's 
pride 
after  their  heaviest  defeat since 
1961 when  the  team was launched 
.. 
* A  second half goal by

earned  Mukorob  Tigers , 
a well-deserved  victory  over relegation  
prone

however,  recovered in

SA  and  Zambia in epic  soccer  battle 
JOHANNESBURG:  Al­
though  beaten 1-0 by Zam­
bia in  a hard  fought  Africa Cup 
of N atioDs  clash  at Johannesburg's  
FNB 
Sta­
dium  yesterday  the ' South 
African  soccer  side regained 
much  of their shattered  pride. Thrashed  
4-1  by 
Zim­babwe 
in their  first  Africa Cup  
game 
in Harare  two weeks  
ago,  the 
South  Afri­
cans  played  their  hearts  out against  
the  highly-rated Zambians,  
who  'have 
fea­
tured in four  Africa  Cup  finals. 
The  
local  side  obviously learnt  
a lot  from  that  batter- , ing 
in Zimbabwe  and sur­
prised  the  Zambians  with hard,  
first-time  tackling 
and 
were,  in  fact,  desperately unlucky  
not  to  have  earned at 
least  a draw. 
"We thought  this  would be  
a walkover  for  us,  but 
we 
were  very  surprised  by  the 
South Africans.  It was  a 50-50 
game  and  at  the  end of 
the  day  I would not  have complained  
had  we  got  a.  draw.  
But  we  are  delighted to  
have 
won," said Zam­
bia's administrative  man­ager,  
George  Mungwa. Disappointing  
however was  
the  poor  attendance. 
An 
estimated  crowd of only 
about 20 000 witnessed  what 
turned out to be an  epic  battle . Defeated,  
but  far  from 
dis­
graced,  was  the  verdict on 
this South African prefor­
mance.  They  have  at  least shown  
that  they 
will, ,in time , to  
be  able  to  hold  their  own 
in the  tough  Africa Cup. 
The  day was soured  for 
SA when striker,Chippa 
Masinga  was  shown  the  red 
card for  an  over  the  ball tackle  
on 
Samuel Chomba in  
the  dying  minutes 
of in­
jury tinl e.The  winning  goal 
waS netted by striker Timo­
thy  Mwitwa  in  the nnd 
minute. 
South Africa  had the  bet­
ter of the first  half  exchanges and  
were  desperately  un­lucky  
not  to  have  changed
