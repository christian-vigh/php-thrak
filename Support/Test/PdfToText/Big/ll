Introduction
The Rich Text Format (RTF) is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within 
applications and for transfer between applications. Users oftendepend on special translation 
software to move word-processing documents between various applications developed by 
different companies. RTF serves as both a standard of data transfer between word processing 
software, document formatting, and a means of migrating content from one operating system to 
another.RTFallowsdocuments to migrate forward and backward in time: old readers can read 
the most recentRTF and new readers can read oldRTF. The only otherwidely usedrich-text 
format that hasthisflexibilityis HTML,which is not nearly as rich.
This document specifies the format used by RTF for text and graphics interchange. RTF usually 
uses ASCII (lower byte range –7 bits) to represent rich text, with runs of text that include 
nonASCII characters requiring conversion to appropriate code values. This version of the RTF 
Specificationincludes all control words introduced byMicrosoft Office Word up through Word 
2007.ForMicrosoft Word for Windows®95 on, the Index of RTF Control Words in Appendix B
reveals the version of Word that added the control words.It also reveals the control words 
defined in the 1987 Microsoft Systems Journal RTF article.Files created with an earlier version 
of Word using RTF should be read without problem by newer versions of Word.Older versions of 
Word ignore control words and groups they don’t understand.
Software that can convert rich textto RTF is called an RTF writer. An RTF writer separates the 
application’s control information from the actual text and writes a file containing the text and the 
RTF command groups associated with that text. Software that reads an RTF file and is capable of 
interpreting or discardingthe formatting commands is called an RTF reader.
A sample RTF parsing reader programis given inAppendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application. 
This sample RTF readeris designed for use in conjunction with this document to assist those 
interested in developing their own RTF readers. The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, 
and Microsoft does not provide technical support or any other kind of support for the sample RTF 
parsing reader code or this document.
Basic Entities
RTF files are usually 7-bit ASCII plain text, consistingof control words, control symbols, and 
groups. RTF files are easily transmitted between most PC based operating systems because of 
their7-bit ASCII characters. However, converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for 
Windows or Microsoft Word for the Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters
and binary data (see \binN) can contain any 8-bit values. Unlike most clear text files, an RTF 
file does not have to contain anycarriage return/line feed pairs (CRLFs)and CRLFs shouldbe 
ignoredby RTF readers except that they can act as control word delimiters.RTF files are more 
readable whenCRLFs occur at major group boundaries.
Control Word
An RTF control wordis a specially formatted command used to mark characters for display on a 
monitor or charactersdestined for a printer. A control word’sname cannot be longer than 32 
letters. 
A control word is defined by:
\<ASCII LetterSequence><Delimiter>
where <Delimiter> marks the end of the control word’s name. For example:

A backslash begins each control word and the control word is case sensitive.
The <ASCII LetterSequence>is made up of ASCII alphabetical characters (a through z andA 
through Z). Control words (also known as keywords) originally did not contain any uppercase 
characters, however in recent years uppercase characters appear in some newer control words.
The <Delimiter>can be one of the following:

A space.Thisserves only to delimit a control word and is ignored in subsequent processing.

A numeric digit or an ASCII minus sign (-), which indicates that a numeric parameter is associated with 
the control word. The subsequent digital sequence is then delimited by any character other than an
ASCII digit (commonly another control word that begins with a backslash). The parameter can be a 
positive or negative decimal number. The range of the values for the number is nominally–32768
through 32767, i.e., a signed 16-bitinteger. A small number of control words take values in the range
−2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647(32-bit signed integer). These control words include \binN, 
\revdttmN, \rsidNrelated control words and some picture propertieslike \bliptagN. Here N stands 
for the numeric parameter. An RTF parser must allow for up to 10 digits optionally preceded by a minus 
sign. If the delimiter is a space, it is discarded, that is, it’s not included in subsequent processing.
Any character other than a letter or a digit. In this case, the delimiting character terminates the control 
word andis not part of the control word. Such as a backslash “\”, which means a new control word or a 
control symbol follows.
If a single space delimits the control word, the space does not appear in the document (it’s 
ignored). Any characters following the single space delimiter, including any subsequent spaces, 
will appear as text or spaces in the document. For this reason, you should use spaces only 
where necessary. It is recommended to avoidspaces as a means of breaking up RTF syntax to 
make it easier to read. You can use paragraph marks (CR,LF, or CRLF) to break up lines without 
changing the meaningexcept in destinations that contain\binN.
In this document, a control word that takes a numeric parameter Nis written with the N, as 
shown here for \binN, unless the control wordappears with an explicit value. The only
exceptionsto this are“toggle” control words like \b(bold toggle), which have only two states. 
When such a control word has no parameter or has a nonzero parameter, the control word turns 
the propertyon. When such a control word has a parameter of 0, the control word turns the 
propertyoff. For example, \bturns on bold and \b0turns off bold.In thedefinitions of these 
toggle control words,the control word names are followed byan asterisk.
Units
Theparameter Noften specifies a dimension. The units used for dimensions in RTF may be
points (pts), half pts, twips, Word device-independent units,EMUs, or pixels,depending on the 
control word. These units are summarized in the table

EMUs914400/inch, 36000/mm, 12700/pt, 635/twip

EMUs (English-Metric Units) areused for some drawing parameter dimensions(see \shp)and 
pixels areused for some bitmap and metafile dimensions.EMUs are accurate for inches, 
millimeters, points, and twips. The most commonly used unitsin RTFare twips.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Introduction

Control Symbol
A control symbolconsists of a backslash followed by a single, non-alphabetical character. For 
example, \~(backslash tilde) represents a non-breaking space. Control symbols do not have 
delimiters, i.e., a space following a control symbol is treated as text, not a delimiter.
Group
A groupcan consist of text, control words, or control symbols enclosed in braces ({}). The 
opening brace ({)indicates the start of the group and the closing brace (}) indicates the end 
of the group. Each group specifies the text affected by the group and the different attributes of 
that text. The RTF file can also include groups for fonts, styles, screen color, pictures, footnotes, 
comments (annotations), headers and footers, summary information, fields, bookmarks, 
document-, section-, paragraph-and character-formatting properties, mathematics, images, 
and objects. If the font, file, style, color, revision mark, and summary-information groups and 
document-formatting properties are included in the file, they must appear in the RTF header, 
which precedes the RTF body. If the content of any group is not used, the groupcan be omitted. 
The groups are discussed in the following sections.Any group that uses the properties defined in 
another group must appear after the group that defines those properties.For example, color and 
font properties must precede the style group.
Destinations
Certain control words, referred to as destinations, mark the beginning of a collection of related 
text that could appear at another position, or destination, within the document. Destinations 
may also include text that is used but doesnot appear within the document at all. An example 
of a destination is the \footnotegroup, where the footnote text follows the control word. Page 
breaks cannot occur in destination text. A destination control word and itsassociatedtext must 
be enclosed in braces. 
Destinations added after the 1987 RTF Specificationmay be preceded by the control symbol \*
(backslash asterisk). This control symbol identifies destinations whose related text should be 
ignored if the RTF reader does not recognizethe destination control word. RTF writers should 
follow the convention of using this control symbol when adding new destinationsor groups. 
Destinations whose related text should be inserted into the document even if the RTF reader 
does not recognize the destination should not use \*.
Most formatting specified within a group affects only the text within that group (including nested
groups within that group). Generally, text within a group inherits the formatting of the text in 
the outer group. However, Microsoft implementations of RTF assume that the footnote, 
annotation, header, and footer groups (described later in this specification) do not inherit the 
formatting of the outergroup. Therefore, to ensure that these groups are formatted correctly, 
you should set the formatting within these groups to the appropriate default with the \sectd, 
\pard, and \plain control words, and then add any desired formatting.
The control words, control symbols, and braces constitute control information. All other 
characters in the file are plain textor data. Here is an example containingplain text that does 
not exist within aninside group:

Even though “This is plain text.” is not part of an insidegroup, it is part of theencompassing 
{\rtf1...}group and hence is part of thebody of the RTF file. It is subject to the formatting 
specified by and after the \pardcommand.Specifically, the \pardresets any previous 
paragraph formatting, \plainresets any previous character formatting,and \fs20sets the font 
size to 20 half points, i.e., 10 points.
As previously mentioned, the backslash (\) and braces ({}) have special meaning in RTF. To
use these characters as text, precede them with a backslash, as inthe control symbols\\, \{, 
and \}.
Conventions of an RTF Reader
The reader of an RTF stream is concerned with the following:

Separating control information from plain text.
Acting on control information.
Collecting and properly inserting text into the document, as directed by the current group state.
Acting on control information is designed to be a relatively simple process. Some control 
information addsspecial characters to the plain text stream. Other information serves to change 
the program state, which includes properties of the document as a whole, or to change any of a 
collection of group states, which apply to parts of the document.
Agroup state can specify the following:

The destination, or part of the document that the plain text is constructing.
Character-formatting properties, such as bold or italic.
Paragraph-formatting properties, such as justified or centered.
Section-formatting properties, such as the number of columns.
Table-formatting properties, which define the number of cells and dimensions of a table row.
In practice, an RTF reader will evaluate each character it reads in sequence as follows:

If the character is an opening brace ({), the reader stores its current stateon the stack. If the character 
is a closing brace (}), the reader retrieves the current state from the stack.

If the character is a backslash (\), the reader collects the control word or control symbol and its 
parameter, if any, and looks up the control word or control symbol in a table that maps control words to 
actions. It then carries out the action prescribed in the lookup table. (The possible actions are discussed 
in the following table.) The read pointer is left before or after a control-word delimiter, as appropriate.
If the character is anything other than an opening brace ({), closing brace (}),backslash (\), or a CRLF 
(carriage return/line feed), the reader assumes that the character is plain text and writes the character 
to the current destination using the current formatting properties.
If the RTF reader cannot find a particular control word or control symbol in the lookup table 
described in the preceding list, the control word or control symbol should be ignored. If the
control word or control symbol is preceded by an opening brace ({), it is part of a group. The 
current state should be saved on the stack, but no state change should occur. When a closing 
brace (}) is encountered, the current state should be retrieved from the stack, thereby resetting 
the current state. If anunknown control word is preceded by '{\*', then it starts an ignorable 
destination group. The RTF reader should discard all text up to and including the closing brace 
(}) that closes this group. All RTF readers must recognizeall destinations defined in the 1987 
RTF Specification. The reader may skip past the whole ignorable destination group, but it is not 
allowed to discard the leading control wordalone. Ignorable destinations defined since the1987 
RTF Specificationare marked with the \*control symbol, unless they always appear within 
groups so marked.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Introduction

Note: All RTF readers must implement the \*control symbol so that they can read RTF files written by newer RTF 
writers.
For control words or control symbols that the RTF reader can find in the lookup table, the 
possible actions are as follows.

ActionDescription
Change DestinationThe RTF reader changes the destination to the destination described in the table entry. 
Destination changes are legal only immediately after an opening brace ({). (Other 
restrictions may also apply; for example, footnotes cannot be nested.) Many destination 
changes imply that the current property settings will be reset to their default settings. 
Examples of control words that change destination are \footnote, \header, \footer, 
\pict, \info, \fonttbl, \stylesheet, and \colortbl. This specification identifies all 
destination control words where they appear in control-word tables.
Change Formatting PropertyThe RTF reader changes the property as described in atable entry. Ifa parameter is 
required, an Nappears at the end of the control word name. Appendix B: Index of RTF 
Control Wordsat the end of this Specification also specifies which control words require 
parameters. If a parameter is needed and not specified, then a default value is used. The 
default value used depends on the control word. If the control word does not specify a 
default, then RTF readers should assume a default of 0except for the toggle control 
words (like \b), which have a default of 1.
Insert Special CharacterThe reader inserts into the document the character code or codes described in the table 
entry.
InsertSpecial Character and 
Perform Action
The reader inserts into the document the character code or codes described in the table 
entry. Then the reader performs the action the entry specifies. For example, when 
Microsoft Word interprets \par, a paragraph markis inserted in the document and 
special code is run to record the paragraph properties belonging to that paragraph mark.

Formal Syntax
RTF uses the following syntax, based on Backus-Naur Form.

Contents of an RTF File
An RTF file has the following syntax:
<File>'{' <header> <document> '}'

This syntax is the standard RTF syntax; any RTF reader must be able to interpret RTF written to 
this syntaxcorrectly. It is worth mentioning again that RTF readers are not required to interpret 
all control words, but they must be able to harmlessly ignore unknown (or unused) control 
words, and they must be able to skip over destinations marked with the \*control symbol. 
There may be RTF writers that generate RTF that does not conform to this syntax, and as such, 
RTF readers should be robust enough to handle some minor variations. Nonetheless, if an RTF 
writer generates RTF conforming to this specification, then any correct RTF reader should be 
able to interpret it.

Note: RTF readers can reject inputif strongly illegal data is encountered that is most probably created maliciously. 
For example, if the table cellwidthcontrol word \cellxNis encountered outside of a table, the RTF reader should 
probably reject the file.
Header
The header has the following syntax:

<header>\rtf1\fbidis? <character set> <from>?<deffont> <deflang><fonttbl>?<filetbl>? 
<colortbl>? <stylesheet>? <stylerestrictions>? <listtables>? <revtbl>? <rsidtable>? 
<mathprops>? <generator>?
Each of the various header tables should appear, if they exist, in this order. Document 
properties can occur before and between the header tables. A property must be defined before 
being referenced. Specifically,

The style sheet must occur before any style usage.
The font table must precede any reference to a font(except those in <deffont>).
The default font keyword(s)must precede any text not explicitly formatted by a font, because they 
specifythe fontsto use in such cases.
RTF Version
An entire RTF file is considered a group and must be enclosed in braces. The \rtfNcontrol word 
must follow the opening brace. The numeric parameter Nidentifies the major version of the RTF 
Specification used. The RTF standard described in this specification, although titled as version 
1.9.1, continues to correspond syntactically to RTF Specification version 1. Therefore, the 
numeric parameter Nfor the \rtfNcontrol word should still be emitted as 1.
Character Set
After specifying the RTF version, you must declare the default character set used in the
documentunless it is \ansi(the default). The control word for the character set must precede 
any plain text or any table control words. The RTF Specification supports the following document 
character sets<character set>

Note that runs of text marked with a particular font index (see \fNin the Font Tablesection) 
use the codepage for that font as given by \cpgNor implied by \fcharsetN, unless they use 
Unicode RTF described in the following section. 
Unicode RTF
From Word 97 onward, Wordis based on Unicode. Text characters can behandled using the 16bit Unicode character-encoding schemedefined in this section. Expressing this text in RTF 
requireda new mechanism, because until Word 97, RTF handled only 7-bit characters directly 
and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimalusing \'xx. The Unicode mechanism described here 
can be applied to any RTF destination or body text.

Control wordMeaning
\ucNThis keyword represents the number(count)of bytes that follow a \uNUnicode character togive 
the codepage code that best corresponds to the Unicode character. This keyword may be used at 
any time, and values are scoped like character properties. That is, a \ucNkeyword applies only 
to text following the keyword, and within the same (or deeper) nested braces. On exiting the 
group, the previous \ucNvalue is restored. The reader must keep a stack of counts seen and 
use the most recent one to skip the appropriate number of characters when it encounters a \uN
keyword. Whenleaving an RTF group that specified a \ucNvalue, the reader must revert to the 
previous value. A default of 1 should be assumed if no \ucNkeyword has been seen in the 
current or outer scopes.
A common practice is to emit no ANSI representation for Unicode characters within a Unicode 
destination context (that is, inside a \uddestination). Typically, the destination will contain a 
\uc0control sequence. There is no need to reset the count on leaving the \uddestination, 
because the scoping rules will ensure the previous value is restored.
\uNThis keyword represents a single Unicode character that has no equivalent ANSI representation 
based on the current ANSI code page. Nrepresents the Unicode character value expressed as a 
decimal number.
This keywordis followed immediately by equivalent character(s) in ANSI representation. In this 
way, old readers will ignore the \uNkeyword and pick up the ANSI representation properly. 
When this keyword is encountered, the reader should ignore the next N'characters, where N'
corresponds to the last \ucN'value encountered.
As with all RTF keywords, a keyword-terminating space may be present (before the ANSI 
characters) that is not counted in the characters to skip. While this is not likely to occur (or 
recommended),a \binNkeyword, its argument, and the binary data that follows are considered 
one character for skipping purposes. If an RTF scope delimiter character (that is, an opening or 
closing brace) is encountered while scanning skippable data, the skippable datais considered to 
end before the delimiter. This makes it possible for a reader to perform some rudimentary error 
recovery. To include an RTF delimiter in skippable data, it must be represented using the 
appropriate control symbol (that is, escaped with a backslash,) as in plain text. Any RTF control 
word or symbol is considered a single character for the purposes of counting skippable \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Header

Control wordMeaning
characters.
An RTF writer, when it encounters a Unicode character with no corresponding ANSI character, 
should output \uNfollowed by the best ANSI representation it can manage. Often a question 
mark is used if no reasonable ANSI character exists. In addition, if the Unicode character 
translates into an ANSI character stream with a count of bytes differing from the current Unicode 
Character Byte Count, it should emit theappropriate\ucNkeyword prior to the \uNkeywordto 
notify the reader of the change.
Most RTF control words accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. For these control words, 
Unicode values greater than 32767areexpressed as negative numbers.For example, the 
character code U+F020 is given by \u-4064. To get -4064, convert F02016to decimal (61472) 
and subtract 65536.
Occasionally Word writes SYMBOL_CHARSET (nonUnicode) characters in the range 
U+F020..U+F0FF instead of U+0020..U+00FF. Internally Word uses the values U+F020..U+F0FF 
for these characters so that plain-text searches don’t mistakenly match SYMBOL_CHARSET 
characters when searching for Unicode characters in the range U+0020..U+00FF. To find out the 
correct symbol font to use, e.g., Wingdings, Symbol, etc., find the last SYMBOL_CHARSET font 
control word \fNused, look up font Nin the font table and find the face name. The charset is 
specified by the \fcharsetNcontrol word and SYMBOL_CHARSET is for N= 2.This corresponds 
to codepage 42.
\uprThis keyword represents a destination with two embedded destinations, one represented using 
Unicode and the other using ANSI. This keyword operates in conjunction with the \ud keyword to 
provide backward compatibility. The general syntax is as follows:
'{' \upr'{' keyword ansi_text '}{\*' \ud'{' keyword Unicode_text '}}}'
Notice that the \uprkeyword destination does not use the \* keyword; this forces the old RTF 
readers to pick up the ANSI representation and discard the Unicode one.
\udThis destination is represented in Unicode. The text is represented using a mixture of ANSI 
translation and \uN keywords to represent characters that do not have exact ANSI equivalents.

Document Text
Document text should be emitted as ANSI characters. If there are Unicode characters that do 
not have corresponding ANSI characters, they should be output using the \ucNand \uN
keywords.
For example, the text “LabValue”(Unicode characters 0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 0x0393, 
0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be represented as follows (assuming a 
previous \uc1):
Lab\u915GValue
Destination Text
Destination text is defined as any text represented in an RTF destination. A good example is the 
bookmark name in the \bkmkstartdestination.
Anydestination containing Unicode characters canbe written as a pair of destinations, one
within a \uprgroup thatensuresold readers can read it properly and the other within a \ud
groupthatensuresno Unicode character encoding is lost when read with a new reader.
For example, a bookmark name “LabValue”(Unicode characters 0x004c, 0x0061, 0x0062, 
0x0393, 0x0056, 0x0061, 0x006c, 0x0075, 0x0065) should be represented as follows
(assuming an active \uc1):

The first sub destination contains only ANSI characters and is the representation that old 
readers will see. The second sub destination is a \*\ud destination that contains a second copy 
of the \bkmkstartdestination. This copy can contain Unicode characters and is the 
representation that Unicode-aware readers must pay attention to, ignoring the ANSI-only 
version.
Note: this example could also be expressed as (assumingan active \uc1)
{\*\bkmkstart Lab\u915GValue}


Default Fontsand Languages
Default font settings can be used to tell the program what regional settings are appropriate as 
defaults. For example, having a Japanese font set in \stshfdbchN would tell Word to enable 
Japanese formatting options. Here Nrefers to an entry in the font table.The syntax for <from>, 
<deffont> and <deflang> appearing in the RTF Header is

<from>\fromtext | \fromhtml

<deffont>\deffN?\adeffN?(\stshfdbchN\stshflochN \stshfhichN\stshfbiN)?

<deflang>\deflangN? \deflangfeN?\adeflangN?



Control wordMeaning
\fromtextIndicates document was originally plain text email.

\fromhtmlNIndicates document was originally HTML email and may contain encapsulated HTML tags. This keyword may be followed by a version number (currently 1).


\deffNDefines default font to be \fNin case text is encountered before any \fNcontrol word is 
active.

\adeffNDefines default BiDi font to be \fNin case BiDi text is encountered before any \fNcontrol 
word is active.

\stshfdbchNDefines default East Asian font for style sheets.

\stshflochNDefines default ASCII font for style sheets.

\stshfhichNDefines default High-ANSI font for style sheets. 

\stshfbiNDefines default Complex Script (BiDi) font for style sheets. 

\deflangNDefines default language to be used when the\plaincontrol wordis encountered. See the 
standard language tablefor a list of possible values for N.

\deflangfeNDefault language ID for East Asian text in Word.

\adeflangNDefault language ID for South Asian/Middle Eastern text in Word. The default languages are 
determined by the current primary editing language and the enabled editing languages (can 
be changed via Microsoft Office Language Settings applet).

Default font settings can be used to tell the program what regional settings are appropriate as 
defaults. For example, having a Japanese font set in \stshfdbchN would tell Word to enable 
Japanese formatting options. Nrefers to anentry in the font table.
Theme Data 
A document’s Theme Data contains a hex-encoded representation of a set of styling that can be 
applied to objects within a document and which affects the look of the document and the 
information and objects it contains.For example, in a Word 2007 document, shapes can have a \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Header

Note: For <fontemb>, either <fontfname> or <data>must be present, although both may be present.

Note: When <themefont> is present, related font information such as the font name, PANOSE information is still 
provided so that theme-unaware applications can read what the given font evaluates to while safely ignoring the 
theme control words new to Word 2007. Only \fcharsetNand \cpgNprovide any additional information to the 
entry that is not already contained in <themefont>.


All fonts available to the RTF writer can be included in the font table, even if the document does 
not use all the fonts.
RTF also supports font families so that applications can attempt to intelligently choose fonts if 
the exact font is not present on the reading system. RTF uses the following control words to 
describe the various font families.

Control wordFont familyExamples
\fnilUnknown or default fonts (the default)Not applicable
\fromanRoman, proportionally spaced serif fontsTimes New Roman, Palatino
\fswissSwiss, proportionally spaced sans serif fontsArial

\fdecorDecorative fontsOld English, ITC Zapf Chancery
\ftechNon Unicode, technicalandsymbolfontsSymbol, Wingdings
\fbidiArabic, Hebrew, or other bidirectional fontMiriam

If an RTF file uses a default font, the default font number is specified with the \deffNcontrol 
word, which must precede the font-table group. The RTF writer supplies the default font number 
used in the creation of the document as the numeric argument N. The RTF reader then 
translates this number through the font table into the most similarfont available from the 
reader’s operating system.
The following control words specify thefont character set, alternative font name, pitch of a font 
in the font table, and non-tagged font name.

\fprqN Specifies the pitch of a font in the font table.

PitchN
Default pitch0
Fixed pitch1
Variable pitch2
\*\panoseDestination keyword. This destination contains a 10-byte Panose 1 number. Each byte represents 
a single font propertyas described by the Panose 1 standard specification.
\*\fnameOptional font-table control word thatdefines the nontagged font name, that is, the name without 
the tagthat identifies thecharacter set being used. For example, Arial is a nontagged font name, 
and Arial (Cyrillic) is a tagged font name. This control word is used by WordPad. Word ignores 
this control word (and never creates it).
\fbiasNUsed to arbitrate between two fonts when a particular character can exist in either a non-East 
Asian or anEast Asian font. Word 97 through Word 2007 emit the \fbiasNkeyword only in the 
context of bullets or list information (that is, a \listleveldestination). The default value of 0 for 
Nindicates a non-East Asian font. A value of 1 indicates an East Asian font. Additional values 
may be defined in future releases.
\fcharsetN Specifies the character set of a font in the font table. If this appears, it implies that bytes in runs 
tagged with the associated \fNare character codes in the codepage correspondingto the charset 
N. Use this codepage to convert the codes to Unicode using a function like the Windows 
MultiByteToWideChar(). See also the \cpgNcontrol word, which, if it appears, supersedes the 
codepage given by \fcharsetN. Values for Nare defined, for example,inthe Windows header 
file wingdi.h (e.g., see ANSI_CHARSET)and are repeated here together with the corresponding 
Windows or Mac codepages for convenience:

Font Embedding
RTF supports embedded fonts with the \fontembgroup located inside a font definition. An 
embedded font can be specified by a file name, or the actual font data may be located inside the 
group. If a file name is specified, it is contained in the \fontfilegroup. The \cpgNcontrol word 
can be used to specify the character set for the file name.
RTF supports TrueTypeand other embedded fonts. The type of the embedded font is described 
by the following control words.

Control wordEmbedded font type
\ftnilUnknown or default font type (the default)
\fttruetypeTrueType font

Code Page Support
A font may have adifferent character set from the character set of the document. For example, 
the Symbol font has the same characters in the same code positions both on the Macintosh and 
in Windows. Typically, RTF fonts usethe code page corresponding to the \fcharsetNcontrol 
word in their \fonttbl description. If the charset doesn’t exist, the codepage may be given by 
the \cpgNcontrol word, for which the code pageis N. If the \cpgNdoes appear, it supersedes 
the code page corresponding to the \fcharsetN.For such cases, codepage conversions can be 
avoided altogether by using the Unicode \uN notation for characters. Inaddition, file names 
(used in field instructions and in embedded fonts) may not necessarily be the same as the 
character set of the document; the \cpgNcontrol word can change the character set for these 
file names as well. However, all RTF documents must still declare a character set (that is, \ansi,
\mac,\pc, or \pca) to maintain backward compatibility with earlier RTF readers.
The valid values for \cpgNare given in the \ansicpgNtable.
Theme Font Information
The following control words may be emitted along with a particular font entry in the RTF font table 
and specify the entry’s relation to the document’s theme.

Note: When oneof thesecontrol wordsis present, related font information such as the font name, PANOSE 
information is still provided so that theme-unaware applications can read what the given font evaluates to while 
safely ignoring the theme control words new to Microsoft Office Word 2007.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Font and Color Tables

\fdbminorSpecifies font entry uses East Asian variation of the “Body” theme font. 
\fbiminorSpecifies font entry uses complex scripts variation of the “Body” theme font.

File Table
The \filetblcontrol word introduces the file table destination. The only time a file table is 
created in RTF is when the document contains subdocuments. The file table group defines the 
files referenced in the document and has the following syntax:

<filetbl> '{\*' \filetbl ('{' <fileinfo> '}')+ '}'
<fileinfo>\file\fidN\frelativeN?\fosnumN? <filesource>+ <file name>
<filesource>\fvalidmac| \fvaliddos| \fvalidntfs| \fvalidhpfs| \fnetwork |\fnonfilesys
<file name>#PCDATA


Note: The file name can be any valid alphanumeric string for the named file system, indicating the complete path 
and file name.

Control wordMeaning
\filetblA list of documents referenced by the current document. The file table has a structure analogous 
to the style or font table. This is a destination control word that is output as part of the document 
header.
\fileMarks the beginning of a file group, which lists relevant information about the referenced file. 
This is a destination control word.
\fidNFile ID number. Files are referenced later in the document using this number.
\frelativeNThe character position within the path (starting at 0) where the referenced file's path starts to be 
relative to the path of the owning document. For example, if a document is saved to the path 
C:\Private\Resume\File1.doc and its file table contains the path 
C:\Private\Resume\Edu\File2.doc, then that entry in the file table will be \frelative18, to point 
at the character "E" in "Edu". This allows preservation of relative paths.
\fosnumNCurrently only filled in for paths from the Macintosh file system. It is an operating system–
specific number for identifying the file, which may be used to speed up access to the file or find 
the file if it was moved to anotherfolder or disk. The Macintosh operating system name for this 
number is the "file id." Additional meanings of the \fosnumNcontrol word may be defined for 
other file systems in the future.
\fvalidmacMacintosh file system.
\fvaliddosMS-DOS file system.
\fvalidntfsNTFS file system.
\fvalidhpfsHPFS file system.
\fnetworkNetwork file system. This control word may be used in conjunction with any of the previous file 
source control words.

Color Table
The \colortblcontrol word introduces the color table group, which defines screen colors, 
character colors, and other color information. The color table group has the following syntax:
<colortbl>'{' \colortbl<colordef>+ '}'
<colordef><themecolor>? & \ctintN? & \cshadeN? \redN? & \greenN? &\blueN? ';'
<themecolor>\cmaindarkone| \cmainlightone| \cmaindarktwo| \cmainlighttwo| 
\caccentone| \caccenttwo| \caccentthree| \caccentfour| \caccentfive| 
\caccentsix| \chyperlink| \cfollowedhyperlink| \cbackgroundone|
\ctextone| \cbackgroundtwo| \ctexttwo

Note: When <themecolor> is used, the red/green/blue values are still provided so that theme-unaware 
applications can read what the given color evaluates to while safely ignoring the theme control words 
introducedbyWord 2007.
For example, consider the following sample RTF code of a color table group:

{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0;
\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;
\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128;
\red128\green0\blue0;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192;
\caccentone\ctint255\cshade191\red174\green150\blue56;}


The following are valid control words for this group.For the <themecolor>control words, a
\ctintNand \cshadeNcan be specified if thecolor entry describes a tint or a shade of the 
theme color.

Control wordMeaning
\colortblDestination for color table definitions
\redNRed intensity, such that0 ≤ N≤255, i.e., 8 bits per RGB color component
\greenNGreen intensity, such that0≤ N≤ 255.
\blueNBlue intensity, such that0 ≤ N≤ 255.
\ctintNSpecifies the tint of the given theme when specifying a theme color. If the entry references a 
theme color, \ctintNspecifies its shade. If not, \ctintNis ignored. 
Here 0 ≤ N≤ 255,where 255 means no tint, and 0 means full tint (resulting in white color). If 
this control word is not specified, a value of 255 is implied. 
Note: If the parameter of this control word is less than 255, the parameter of the \cshade control 
word must be equal to 255. A tint or a shade may be specified, but not both.
\cshadeNSpecifies the shade of the given theme when specifying a theme color. If the entry references a 
theme color, \cshadeNspecifies its shade. If not, \cshadeNis ignored. 
Here 0 ≤ N≤ 255,where 255 means no shade, and 0 means full shade (resulting in black color).
If this control word is not specified, a value of 255 is implied. 
Note: If the parameter of this control word is less than 255, the parameter of the \ctintN
control word must be equal to 255. A tint or a shade may be specified, but not both.
\cmaindarkoneColor entry references “Main Dark 1” theme color. 
\cmainlightoneColor entry references “Main Light 1” theme color. 
\cmaindarktwoColor entry references “Main Dark 2” theme color
\cmainlighttwoColor entry references “Main Light 2” theme color.

\caccentthreeColor entry references “Accent 3” theme color. 
\caccentfourColor entry references “Accent 4” theme color. 
\caccentfiveColor entry references “Accent 5” theme color. 
\caccentsixColor entry references “Accent 6” theme color
\chyperlinkColor entry references “Hyperlink” theme color

\ctextoneColor entry references “Text 1” theme color. 
\cbackgroundtwoColor entry references “Background 2” theme color. 
\ctexttwoColor entry references “Text 2” theme color. 

Each definition must be delimited by a semicolon, even if the definition is omitted. If a color 
definition is omitted, the RTF reader uses its default color. The following example defines the 
default color table used by Word. The first color is omitted, as shown by the semicolon following 
the\colortbl control word. The missing definition indicates that color 0 is the “auto”color.

{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;\red0\green0\blue255;\red0\green255\blue255;\red0\green255\blue0;
\red255\green0\blue255;\red255\green0\blue0;\red255\green255\blue0;\red255\green255\blue255;
\red0\green0\blue128;\red0\green128\blue128;\red0\green128\blue0;\red128\green0\blue128;
\red128\green0\blue0;\red128\green128\blue0;\red128\green128\blue128;\red192\green192\blue192;}
The foreground and background colors use indexes into the color table to define a color. The 
following example defines a block of text in color (where supported). Note that the \cfNor 
\cbNindex (color foreground or color background) is the index of an entry in the color table, 
which represents a red/green/blue (RGB) color combination.

{\f1\cb1\cf2 This is colored text. The background is color 1 and the foreground is color 2.}
If the file is read by software that does not display color, the reader should ignore the color 
table group.
Note:Windows versions of Word havenever supported \cbN, but it can be emulated by the control word 
sequence \chshdng0\chcbpatN.
Default Properties
Thefollowingcontrol words correspond to the default properties for the given RTF document.

Style Sheet
The \stylesheetcontrol word introduces the style sheet group, which contains definitions and 
descriptions of the various styles used in the document. All styles in the document's style sheet 
can be included, even if not all the styles are used. In RTF, a style is a form of shorthand used 
to specify a set of character, paragraph, or section formatting.
The style sheet group has the following syntax:
<stylesheet> '{' \stylesheet <style>+ '}'
<style>'{' <styledef>?<keycode>? <formatting> \additive? \sbasedonN? \snextN? \sautoupd? 
\slinkN? \sqformat? \spriorityN? \sunhideusedN? \slocked? \shidden? \ssemihiddenN?
\spersonal? \scompose? \sreply? \styrsidN? <stylename>? ';}'
<styledef>\sN|\*\csN| \*\dsN|\*\tsN \tsrowd
<keycode>'{'\keycode<keys> '}'
<keys>(\shift? & \ctrl? & \alt?) <key>
<key>\fnN| #PCDATA
<formatting>(<brdrdef> | <parfmt> | <apoctl> | <tabdef> | <shading> | <chrfmt>)+
<stylename>#PCDATA

For <style>, both <styledef> and <stylename> are optional; the default is paragraph style 0. 
Note for <stylename> Microsoft Word for the Macintosh interprets commas in #PCDATA as 
separating style synonyms. In addition, for <key>, the data must be exactly one character.

Control wordMeaning
\sNDesignates paragraph style with the style handleN, which can be any 16-bit integer.
\*\csNDesignates character stylewith a style handle N. Like \sN, \csNis not a destination control word. 
However, it is important to treat it like one inside the style sheet; that is, \csNmust be prefixed 
with \*and must appear as the first item inside a group. Doing so ensures that readers that do not 
understand character styles will skip the character style information correctly. When used in body 
text to indicate that a character style was applied, do not include the \*prefix.
\*\dsNDesignates section style with style handle N.
\*\tsNDesignates table style, in the same style as \csNfor placementand prefixes.
\tsrowdLike \trowdbut for table style definitions.
\additiveUsed in a character style definition ('{\*'\csN…'}'). Indicates that character style attributes are to 
be added to the current paragraph style attributes, rather than setting the paragraph attributes to 
only those defined in the character style definition.
\sbasedonNDefines the style handleof the style the current style is based on (default is222—no style).
\snextNDefines the style to be used in the next paragraph after the paragraph marked by this style. If it is 
omitted, the next style is the current style.
\sautoupdAutomatically update styles.
\shiddenStyle does not appear in the Styles drop-down list in the Style dialog box1(on the Format menu, 
click Styles).
\slinkNThe style is linked to the style whose style sheet index is denoted by N.A paragraph style is linked 
to a character style when they share the same font properties and the character style is updated 
when the paragraph style changes.Normally Word willsuppress the display of the linked character 
style in most style lists.
\slockedThe style is locked. It cannot be used in the current document if protection is on.
\spersonalStyle is a personal e-mail style.

Control wordMeaning
\scomposeStyle is the e-mail compose style.
\sreplyStyle is the e-mail reply style.
\styrsidNTied to the rsid table, Nis the rsid of the author who implemented the style.
\ssemihiddenNNnonzero or N missing: style does not appear in drop-down menus.If control word is missing or N
= 0, style may appear in drop-down menus.
\keycodeThis group is specified within the description of a style in the style sheet in the RTF header. The 
syntax for this group is '{\*' \keycode<keys>'}' where <keys>are the characters used in the 
key code. For example, a style, Normal, may be defined {\s0 {\*\keycode \shift\ctrl n}Normal;} 
within the RTF style sheet. See the Special Charactercontrol words for the characters outside the 
alphanumeric range that may be used.
\altThe ALTmodifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles.
\shiftThe SHIFTmodifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles.
\ctrlThe CTRL modifier key. Used to describe shortcut key codes for styles.
\fnNSpecifies a function key where Nis the function key number. Used to describe shortcut-key codes 
for styles.
\sqformat This control word specifies whether this style shall be treated as a primary style when this 
document is loaded by an application. If this control word is present, then this style has been 
designated as being particularly important for the current document, and this information may be 
used by an application in any means desired. 
Note:This setting does not imply any behavior for the style, only that the style is of particular 
significance for this document.
If this element is omitted, then the style shall not be considered a primary style for this document.
\spriorityNThis control word specifies a number that may be used to sort the set of style definitions in a user 
interface when this document is loaded by an application and the recommended setting is specified 
in the \stylesortmethodNcontrol word. 
If N= 1, then this priority shall be used to sort all available styles in ascending value order.
If this control word is omitted, then the style shall not have an associated priority value and shall 
be sorted to the end of the list of style definitions (equivalent to a priority value of infinity) when 
the recommended sort order setting is specified.
\sunhideusedNThis control word specifies whether this style shall be hidden from the main user interface until it is 
used. 
If N = 1, then this style may be used to format content (that is any content which references this 
style shall have its properties as normal), but the style shall be hidden from the main user interface 
associated with that application.
Note:The interpretation of a "main" user interface shall not be dictated by this spec, and may be 
defined by an application as appropriate. This setting is intended to define a style property that 
allows styles to be seen and modified in an advanced user interface, without exposing the style in a 
less advanced setting. For example, the style that is used to format the contents of a comment 
should typically not be shown in a simple user interface, as it is uncommon to want to modify it.
If this control word is omitted orN= 0, then the style shall not be required to be hidden from the 
main user interface.

Some of the control words used in this example are discussed in later sections. Note that the 
properties of the style were emitted following the application of the style. This was done for two 
reasons: (1) to allow RTF readers that do notsupport styles to continue todisplay formatting 
correctly; and (2) to reveal the additive model for styles, where additional property changes are 
“added” on top of the defined style. Some RTF readers may not “apply” a style when only the 
style number is used, unless the accompanying formatting information is provided as well.
Quick Styles
Quick Styles are a set of styles that shouldbe readily available for a user via thehosting 
application’s user interface. The \noqfpromotecontrol word specifies that a hosting application 
shouldnot automatically display the following styles as Quick Styles.

Note: This control word is usually used in conjunction with \sqformatto customize the list of 
Quick Styles displayed by a hosting application when it loads an RTF file. 


Table Styles
Word 2002 introduced table styles. Table styles are like other styles in that they contain 
properties to be shared bymany tables. Unlike the other styles though, table styles allow for 
conditional formatting, such as specifically coloring the first row.
To address the issue of older readers opening newer RTF files, raw properties were 
implemented. Older readers can still see the regular properties and edit them, but newer \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Style Sheets

readers should be able to read the RTF back in and not lose any style functionality. This leaves 
two types of properties:those applied by older writers that are readable by older readers, and 
those theuser applied directly to override aspects of the style. The user-applied changes are 
referred to as “raw” and have a higher priority than their non-raw counterparts have. 
The following table describes keywords available for style definitions. Any older table formatting 
properties may be used as well.

List Tables
Word 97, Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 store bullets and numbering 
information very differently from earlier versions of Word. In Word 6.0, for example, numberformatting data is stored individually with each paragraph. In Word 97 and later versions, 
however, all of the formatting information is stored in a pair of document-wide list tables that 
act as a style sheet, and each individual paragraph stores only an index to one of the tables, like 
a style index.
There are two list tables in Word: the List table (destination \listtable), and the List Override 
table (destination \listoverridetable).
List Table
The first table Word stores is the List table. A List table is a list of lists (destination \list). Each 
list contains a number of list properties that pertain to the entire list, and a list of levels 
(destination \listlevel), each of which contains properties that pertain only to that level. The 
\listpicture destination contains all the picture bullets used in the document, with a \shppict 
headed list of \pict entries. These are referenced within the list by the \levelpictureN
keyword, with N referring to an element in the list, starting at 0.
The syntax for the List table is as follows:
<listtable>'{\*' \listtable<listpicture>? <list>+ '}'
<listpicture>'{\*' \listpicture <shppictlist> '}'
<list>\list\listemplateid& (\listsimple| \listhybrid)? & <listlevel>+ & \listrestarthdn& 
\listidN& (\listname#PCDATA ';') \liststyleidN? \liststylename?
<listlevel>'{' \listlevel<number><justification>&\levelfollowN&\levelstartatN& \lvltentative?
(\leveloldN&\levelprevN?&\levelprevspaceN?&\levelspaceN?&\levelindentN?)?&
<leveltext>&<levelnumbers>&\levellegalN?&\levelnorestartN?&<chrfmt>?& 
\levelpictureN &\liN?&\fiN?& (\jclisttab\txN)?& \linN?'}'
<number>\levelnfcN |\levelnfcnN|(\levelnfcN& \levelnfcnN)
<justification>\leveljcN| \leveljcnN | (\leveljcN&\leveljcnN)
<leveltext>'{' \leveltext \leveltemplateid? #SDATA ';}'
<levelnumbers>'{'\levelnumbers #SDATA ';}'

Top-Level List Properties

Control wordMeaning
\listidNEach list must have a unique list ID that should be randomly generated. Nis a long integer. 
The list ID cannot be between –1 and –5. 
\listtemplateidNEach list should have a unique template ID as well, which also should be randomly generated. 
The template ID –1means the template ID is undefined. Nis a long integer. 
\listsimpleN1 if the list has one level; 0 (default) if the list has nine levels.
\listhybridPresent if the list has 9 levels, each of which is the equivalent of a simple list. Only one of 
\listsimpleNand \listhybridshould be present. Word 2000 and newer versions will write 
lists with the \listhybridproperty.
\listrestarthdnN1 if the list restarts at each section; 0 if not. Used for Word 95compatibility only. 
\listnameThe argument for \listnameis a string that is the name of this list. Names allow ListNum 
fields to specify the list to which they belong. This is a destination control word.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1List Tables

Control wordMeaning
\liststyleidNThis identifies the style of this list from the list style definition that has this ID as its \listidN. 
There can be more than one list style reference to a list style definition. This keyword follows 
the same numbering convention as \listidN.
\liststyleidNand \liststylenameare exclusive; either zero or one of each can exist per\list
definition, but never both.
\liststylenameIdentifies this list as a list style definition. This creates a new list style with the given name and 
the properties of the current list.
\liststyleidNand \liststylenameare exclusive; either zero or one of each can exist per \list
definition, but never both.
While Word 97 emitted simple or multilevel (not simple) lists, Word 2000, Word 2002,Word 
2003, and Word 2007 emit hybridlists, which are essentially collections of simple lists. The main 
difference between Word 2000, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 hybrid lists and Word 
97 multilevel lists is that each level of a hybrid list has a unique identifier.


List Levels
Each list consists of either one or nine list levels depending upon whether the \listsimple flag is 
set. Each list level contains a number of properties that specify the formatting for that level, 
such as the start-at value, the text string surrounding the number, its justification and indents.

Control wordMeaning
\levelstartatNNspecifies the start-at value for the level.
\lvltentative Specifies that a given numbering level was been saved by a producer but was not used in 
the parent document. This means that this numbering level may be redefined by a future 
consumer without changing the actual content of the document.
If this control word is present, the RTF for a given document will contain the numbering 
level information associated with this numbering level, but the 'tentative' numbering 
level(s) shall not be represented in any of the hosting application's user interface pertaining 
to numbering levels.

\leveloldN1 if this level was converted from Word 6.0 or Word 95; 0 if it is a native Word 97 through 
Word 2007level.
\levelprevN1 if this level includes the text from the previous level (used for Word 95compatibility 
only); otherwise, the value is 0. This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldNkeyword 
is emitted.
\levelprevspaceN1 if this level includes the indentation from the previous level (used for Word 95
compatibility only); otherwise, the value is 0. This keyword will only be valid if the 
\leveloldNkeyword is emitted.
\levelindentNMinimum distance from the left indent to the start of the paragraph text (used for Word 95
compatibility only). This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldNkeyword is emitted.
\levelspaceNMinimum distance from the right edge of the number to the start of the paragraph text 
(used for Word 95compatibility only). This keyword will only be valid if the \leveloldN
keyword is emitted.
\leveltextIf the list is hybrid, as indicated by \listhybrid,the \leveltemplateidNkeyword will be 
included, whose argument is a unique level ID that should be randomly generated. The 
valueNis a long integer. The level ID cannot be between (–1) and (–5).
The second argument for this destination should be the number format string for this level. 
The first character is the length of the string, and any numbers within the level should be 
replaced by the index of the level they represent. For example, a level three number such 
as “1.1.1.” would generate the following RTF: “{\leveltext\leveltemplateidN
\'06\'00.\'01.\'02.}” where the ’06 is the string length, the \'00, \'01, and \'02 are the 
level placeholders, and the periods are the surrounding text. This is a destination control

\levelpicturenosizeIf present, do not resize the picture bullet if the size of the \parmarker is changed.

In addition to all of these properties, each list level can contain any character properties (all of 
which affect all text for that level) and any combination of three paragraph properties: left 
indents, first line left indents, and tabs—each of which must be of a special type: \jclisttab. 
These paragraph properties will be automatically applied to any paragraph in the list.
List Override Table
The List Override table is a listof list overrides (destination \listoverride). Each list override 
contains the \listidNof one of the lists in the List table, and a list of any properties it chooses to 
override. Each paragraph will contain a list override index (keyword \lsN), which is a 1-based 
index into this table. Most list overrides do not override any properties—instead, they provide a 
level of indirection to a list. There are generally two types of list overrides:
(1) Formatting overrides. Allows a paragraph to be part of a list and to be numbered along with 
the other members of the list, but have different formatting properties
(2) Start-at overrides. Allows a paragraph to share the formatting properties of a list, but have 
different start-at values. The first element in the document with each list override index takes 
the start-at value that the list override specifies as its value, while each subsequent element is 
assigned the number succeeding the previous element of the list.
List overrides have a few top-level keywords, including a \listoverridecountN, which contains a 
count of the number of levels whose format is overridden. This \listoverridecountNshould 
always be either 0, 1 or 9, depending upon whether the list to be overridden is simple(0 or 1)
or hybrid/multilevel(9). All of the actual override information is stored within a list of list 
override levels (destination\lfolevel).
The syntax for the List Override table is as follows:

<listoverridetable>'{\*' \listoverridetable<listoverride>+ '}'
<listoverride>'{' \listoverride & \listidN & \listoverridecountN& \lsN<lfolevel>? '}'
<lfolevel>'{' \lfolevel \listoverrideformatN? \listoverridestartat? <listlevel> '}'

Control wordMeaning
\listidNShould exactly match the \listidof one of the lists in the List table. The value Nis a 
long integer.
\listoverridecountNNumber of list override levels within this list override (0, 1or 9).
\lsNThe (1-based) index of this \listoverridein the \listoverridetable. This value should 
never be zero inside a \listoverrideand must be unique for all \listoverride’swithin 
a document. The valid values are from 1 to 2000.The value 0 means no list.
\listoverridestartatIndicates an override of the start-at value.
\listoverrideformatNNumber of list format override levels within this list override (should be either 1, 9, or 
missing, which means 0).

Each list override level contains flags to specify whether the formatting or start-at values are 
being overridden for each level. If the formatflag (\listoverrideformatN) is given, the 
\lfolevelshould also contain a list level (<listlevel>). If the start-at flag (\listoverridestartat) 
is given, a start-at value must be provided. If the start-at is overridden but the format is not, 
then a \levelstartatNshould be provided in the <lfolevel>itself. If both the start-at and the 
format are overridden, put the \levelstartatNinside the<listlevel> contained in the
<lfolevel>.


Paragraph Group Properties
Word 2002 introduced paragraph group properties, similar to style sheets. A document using 
paragraph group properties places a \pgptblentry in the header. Elements in the Paragraph 
Group Properties (PGP) table are entered as they are created in the documentand are identified 
withan\ipgpNvalue.Theformatting options are taken from the regular paragraph formatting 
options. PGP table entries may exist with different \ipgpNvalues but with the same properties. 
Any paragraph that references an entry in the PGP table does so by emitting \ipgpN,which sets 
paragraph formatting options according to the entry in the PGP table.Additional formatting 
options may also be employed.
The PGP syntax is as follows:

<pgptbl>'{\*' \pgptbl <entry>+'}'
<entry>'{'\pgp<value> '}'
<value>\ipgpN<parfmt>+


The following is a sample PGP table with two entries:

{\*\pgptbl {\pgp\ipgp13\itap0\li0\ri0\sb0\sa0}{\pgp\ipgp80\itap0\li720\ri0\sb100\sa100}}

Revision Marks
This table allows tracking of multiple authors and reviewers of a document, and is used in 
conjunction with the character properties for tracking changes (using revision marks).\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

Control wordMeaning
\*\revtblThis group consists of subgroups that each identify the author of a revision in the document, as 
in {Author1;}. This is a destination control word.
Revision conflicts, such as those that result when one author deletes another's additions, are 
stored as one group, in the following form:
CurrentAuthor\'00\'<length of previous author's name>PreviousAuthor\'00
PreviousRevisionTime
The 4 bytes of the Date/Time (DTTM) structure are emitted as ASCII characters, so values 
greater than 127 should be emitted as quoted hexadecimal values.


All time references for revision marks use the following bit field structure, DTTM.

Bit numbersInformationRange
0–5Minute0–59
6–10Hour0–23
11–15Day of month1–31
16–19Month1–12
20–28Year= Year –1900
29–31Day of week0 (Sun)–6 (Sat)


RSID
In Word 2002, a new style of revision tracking was established. RSIDs (Revision Save IDs) 
indicate when text or a property was changed. Whenever text is addedor deleted or properties 
are changed, that text or property is tagged with the current "Save ID," which is a random 
number that changes each time the document is saved. They are primarily used when merging 
or comparing twodocuments with a common history but no revision marks. By reviewingthe 
RSID we can tell which of the two authors made the change. Without the RSID we can only tell 
that there is a difference, but we do notknow if (for example) it was an addition by author A or 
a deletion by author B. An RSID table is placed after all other style definitions and before the 
<generator> and <info> groups.Changed textand propertiesis contained in groups with an 
appropriate control word (like\insrsidNfor insertions) thatidentifies the editing session.
The syntax for an RSID table is as follows:

<rsidtable>'{\*' \rsidtbl\rsidN+ '}'



Control wordMeaning

\*\rsidtblDestination for the revision save ID table.

\rsidNEach time a document is saved a new entry is added tothis table, with Nbeing the random 
long integer number assigned to represent the unique session.
\insrsidNAn RSID is inserted where an insertion is made to denote the session in which particular text 
was inserted. Example:if "This is text." is inserted, it will be written in RTF as
{\insrsid8282541 This is text.} 
For use in lists:

Old Properties
With tracking enabled, you can document changes to formatting. To keep track of the property 
before the changes were made, Old Properties werecreated.This tracking uses the following 
syntax:

<oldprop>'{\*' <oldproptype> <oldproperties>+ <trackinginfo>';}'
<oldproptype>\oldcprops | \oldpprops | \oldtprops | \oldsprops
<oldproperties>This section includes any of the relevant format tags that would have to be put in place to 
revert the document to its pre-edit form. For example, this would be \b0if the user had 
chosen to make the selection bold.
<trackinginfo>This can be any tag used to track the author, revision ID, and date.



Control wordMeaning
\oldcpropsOld character formatting properties.

\oldppropsOld paragraph formatting properties.

\oldtpropsOld table formatting properties.

\oldspropsOld section formatting properties.
The following is an example of the correct use of theOld Properties when bold and italicare 
applied to a section of existing text.If the original text “This is a test.” is changed to “This is a
test.”,the following code examplewill be formed, which would tell an RTF reader that to undo 
the change to thecharacter property bold and italic would have to be disabled:

Generator
Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 allow theRTF emitter application to stamp the 
document with its name, version, and build number. The generator area has the following 
syntax:

<generator>'{\*'\generator <name> ';}'
<name>#PCDATA, the name of the program, the version, the build, and any other information about 
the emitting program can be listed here. Word 2002 lists {\*\generator Microsoft Word 
10.0.XXXX} –Word 2003 lists {\*\generator Microsoft Word 11.0.XXXX} –Word 2007 lists 
{\*\generator Microsoft Word 12.0.XXXX}in which XXXX is replaced by the build number. 
Only ASCII text is allowed in this field.

Document Area
Once the RTF header is defined, the RTF reader has enough information to correctly read the 
actual document text. The <document> contains document information followed by one or more 
sections. Ithas the following syntax:

<document><info>? <xmlnstbl>? <docfmt>* <section>+

Information Group
The \infocontrol word introduces the information group, which contains information about the 
document. This can include the title, author, keywords, comments, and other information 
specific to the file. This information is for use by a document-management tool, if available.
The information group has the following syntax:

Some applications, such as Word, ask the user to type this information when saving the 
document in its native format. If the document is then saved as an RTF file or translated into 
RTF, the RTF writer specifies this information using control words in the following table. These 
control words are destinations, and both the control words and the text should be enclosed in 
braces ({}).

Control wordMeaning
\infoDestination for document information group.
\titleTitle of the document. This is a destination control word.
\subjectSubject of the document. This is a destination control word.
\authorAuthor of the document. This is a destination control word.

\hlinkbaseThe base address that is used for the path of all relative hyperlinks inserted in the document. 
This can be a path or an Internet address (URL). This is a destination control word.


The \userpropscontrol word introduces the user-defined document properties. Unique 
\propnamecontrol words define each user-defined property in the document. This group has 
the following syntax:

<userprops>'{\*' \userprops<propinfo>* '}'

Note:the control word \passwordwas supported by Word 2003, but has been deprecated because it is not as 
secure (usesweak encryption).
XML Namespace Table
XML Namespace tables contain the namespaces for XML and SmartTags that are used in an RTFformatted document. 

SmartTags and custom XML markup each provide a facility for embedding customer-defined 
semantics into thedocument as follows: 
•SmartTags use the ability to provide a basic namespace or name for a run or set of runs in a 
document(see Custom XML Tags).
•Custom XML markup uses the ability to tag the document that uses XML elements and 
attributes that are specified by any valid XML Schema file.


The XML Namespace table has the following syntax:

<xmlnstbl>'{\*' \xmlnstbl<xmlnsdecl>* '}'
<xmlnsdecl>'{'\xmlnsN#PCDATA '}'


For example:

{\*\xmlnstbl{\xmlns1 {HYPERLINK "http://exampleuri.org"}}}
The following table lists the Namespace Table control words:



Control wordMeaning
\*\xmlnstblXML namespace table
\xmlnsNXML namespace table entry. This control word is also used in the body text to identify data 
belonging to the corresponding namespace (see Custom XML Tags).

Document Formatting Properties
After the information groupand XML namespace table(if they are present), there may be some 
document formatting control words (referred toas <docfmt> in the document area syntax 
description). These control words are listed in the following table and specify document 
attributes, such as margins and footnote placement. These attributes must precede the first 
plain-text characterin the document.Measurements are in twips,one-twentieth of a point. For 
omitted control words, RTF uses the default values.
Note that three of the document-protection control words (\formprot, \revprot, and 
\annotprot) are mutually exclusive; only one of the three can apply to any given document. \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

\deftabNDefault tab width in twips (default is720, i.e., 0.5").
\hyphhotzNHyphenation hot zone in twips (amount of space at right margin in which words are 
hyphenated).
\hyphconsecNNis maximum number of consecutive lines that are allowed to end in a hyphen. 0 means no 
limit.
\hyphcaps*Switches hyphenation of capitalized words (default ison). Append 1 or leave control word by 
itself to toggle property on; append 0 to turn it off.
\hyphauto*Switches automatic hyphenation (default isoff). Append 1 or leave control word by itself to 
toggle property on; append 0 to turn it off.
\linestartNBeginning line number (default is1).
\fracwidthUses fractional character widths when printing (QuickDraw only).
\*\nextfileThe argument is the name of the next file to print or index; it must be enclosed in braces. 
This is a destination control word.
\*\templateThe argument is the name of a related template file; it must be enclosed in braces. This is a 
destination control word.
\makebackupBackup copy is made automatically when the document is saved.
\muserFlag written if Word 97 compatibility mode is active; ignored when read.
\defformatTells the RTF reader that the document should be saved in RTF format.
\psoverPrints PostScript over the text.
\doctempDocument is a boiler plate document. For Word for Windows, this is a template; for Word for 
the Macintosh, this is a stationery file.
\windowcaptionSets the caption text for the document window. This is a string value.
\doctypeNAn integer (0–2) that describes the document type for AutoFormat.
0General document (for formatting most documents, the default)
1Letter (for formatting letters, and used by Letter Wizard)
2E-mail (for formatting e-mail, and used by WordMail)
\ilfomacatclnupNIf N= 1, thiscontrol word specifies that the last attempt made by the application to remove 
unused abstract numbering definitions from the document was incomplete. If a legacy 
document is opened by a consumer, it may choose to remove abstract numbering definitions 
that are 'orphaned' (have no associated numbering definition instances). This control word is 
used by those consumers to indicate their progress (if incomplete) in reviewing existing 
abstract numbering definitions. 
Note: Removing unused abstract numbering definition from a document will reduce the file 
size, but is not required. 
If omitted or N= 0, then all abstract numbering definitions shall be considered reviewed.

\relyonvmlNIf N= 1, applications may utilize the Vector Mark-up Language (VML) when saving the 
content of this RTF document as a Web page, when graphical elements that can use this 
format are present in the document.
If this control word is omittedor N= 0, then a graphic image format should be used either in 
place of or in concert with the VMLoutput to specify the formatting and positioning for 
objects that are part of the resulting Web page.
Note: This setting is intended for applications to save Web pages that can be supported by 
legacy Web browsers that do not support VMLwhen attempting to read and display the 
resulting Web page. 
\validatexmlNIf N= 1, applications shouldvalidate the custom XML markup in this document against the 
applicable custom XML schema(s), when those schemas are available. If N= 0, the

Control wordMeaning
\*\xform This destination control word specifies the location of a custom XSL transform that shall be 
used when this document is saved as a single XML file.
Note: Because this setting specifies behavior when saving to an alternative file format not 
defined by Office OpenXML, this behavior is optional. 
If this element is omitted, then no custom XSL transform shall be used when saving this file 
as a single XML file. If the \usexformcontrol word is omitted, then this transform shall not 
be applied when the document is saved as a single XML file.
For example, consider the RTF specifying to save through the XSL transform located at 
c:\temp\myxslt.xsl:

{\*\xform c:\\temp\\myxslt.xsl}
\donotembedsysfontNIf N= 0, applications shouldembed common system fonts when they are in use and font 
embedding is enabled for this document. Common system fontsrefer to a set of fonts that 
are typically always present on a computer, and are not defined by this spec.
If this control word is omittedor N= 1, then the set of fonts defined as common system 
fonts should not be embedded in the current document when font embedding is turned on. 
\donotembedlingdataNSpeech, handwriting and controls text service data received from devices connected to 
Microsoft Office using the Windows Text Service Framework Application Programming 
Interface should (N= 0) or should not (N= 1)be embedded in the given RTF document.
\showplaceholdtextNIf N= 1, each custom XML control word within this document shouldalways show some form 
of in-document placeholder text representation when it contains no run content. If 
placeholder text is not specified, then theapplication shall use the name of the control word 
to generate default placeholder text in its place.
If this control word is omittedor N= 0, then custom XML markup that does not have 
placeholder text specified within its properties shouldnot display any placeholder text.
\trackmovesNIf N= 1, applications shouldtrack moves when the \revisionscontrol word is present. If 
move tracking is not enabled (\revisionscontrol word is not present, or is inactive) what 
would otherwise be considered moves are tracked as deletions (\deleted) and insertions 
(\revised).If N= 0, moves should not be tracked.
\trackformattingNIf N= 1, applications shouldtrack revisions made to the formatting of this RTF document 
when the \revisionscontrol word is present. If N= 0, formatting should not be tracked.
\ignoremixedcontentNIf N= 1, applications should ignore all text content that is not contained within a leaf custom 
XML markup control word when validating the contents of the custom XML markup in this 
document against one or more attached custom XML schema(s). 
A leaf control wordis a custom XML control word that has no child custom XML control words 
(it is a leaf in the custom XML tree).
If this control word is omittedor N= 0, then text content in leaf controlwords shouldnot be 
ignored when validating the custom XML markup against one or more custom XML 
schema(s).
\saveinvalidxmlNIf N= 1, this document should be capable of being saved into a format consisting of a single 
XML file when its contents are not valid based on the custom XML markup contained in the 
document. This setting has no effect on documents that do not contain custom XML markup, 
or that do contain custom XML markup but do not have a schema attached. 
Note: Because this setting specifies behavior when saving to an alternative file format not 
defined by this spec, this behavior is optional. 
If this control word is omittedor N= 0, then applications should not allow this document to 
be saved into a single XML file when its contents are not valid based on the custom XML 
markup contained in the document. 
If the \validatexmlNcontrol word is present, then the XML is never invalid and this property 
is ignored.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

\showxmlerrorsNIf N= 1, a visual cue should be displayed on content contained in custom XML markup in an 
RTF document that is considered to be invalid based on the associated XML schema(s).
If this control word is not present in an RTF document or N= 0, visual cues shouldbe not 
displayed.
\stylelockthemeThis control word specifies whether applications shall prevent the modification of the 
document's theme information when editing this document. This setting should not preclude 
the use of the theme information; instead, it should only prevent the modification of the 
theme part in a single operation (either through a user interface or a programmatic 
operation).
If this control word is omitted, then applications may allow the replacement or modification of 
the theme part in this document.
\stylelockqfsetThis control word specifies whether applications shall prevent the replacement of the 
complete set of styles when editing this document. This setting should not preclude the 
editing or removal of individual styles; instead, it should only prevent the removal and 
replacement of the entire styles part in a single operation (either through a user interface or 
a programmatic operation).
If this control word is omitted, then applications may allow the replacement of the entire 
styles part in this document.
\usenormstyforlistThis control word specifies whether applications shall automatically apply their list paragraph 
style when numbering is applied to a paragraph currently formatted using the default 
paragraph style.
Typically, when a paragraph is formatted using the default paragraph style, and numbering is 
subsequently applied, the list paragraph style is applied to ensure that paragraph properties 
are appropriate for a numbered paragraph. 
This control word specifies that no alternate paragraph style shall ever be applied.
\*\wgrffmtfilter This control word is followed by a four-digit hexadecimal string that specifies a set of 
suggested filters that should be applied to the list of document styles in the application if the

If this control word is omitted, then all settings defined by this control word are turned off.
Example: Consider an RTF document containing the following:

{\*\wgrffmtfilter 2002}
This specifies two suggested filter options for the list of document styles:
1)Only custom styles should be shown (0002)
2)Heading styles with a styleIDof Heading1 to Heading3 should always be displayed 
in the list (2000)
\readonlyrecommended Specifies that this document is recommended to be read-only. 
\stylesortmethodNThis control word specifies a suggested sortingthat should be applied to the list of document 
styles in this application if the styles are displayed in a user interface.
If this control word is omitted styles shouldbe sorted as if this control word was present with 
N= 1.

ValueDescription
0Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by their names.
1Specifies that visible styles should be sorted by the default sorting of the host 
application.
Note: In Microsoft Office Word 2007 the default sorting order is specified by

\*\writereservhash This control word contains hex-encoded encrypted data representing the password needed to 
edit the given RTF document. For more information on the encryption algorithm used please 
see the WordprocessingML element documentProtection discussed in Office OpenXML. This is 
a destination control word.
\*\writereservationThis destination control word was used in Word 2003 but has been deprecated in favor of 
\writereservhashsince \writereservationuses weak encryption.
\saveprevpict This control word specifies if a document’s thumbnail should be generated for the contents of 
the first page of this document when saved by an application that supports document 
thumbnail generation.
If this control word is omitted, then applications may choose to save a thumbnail; however, 
that behavior is not required. If this control word is specified, a thumbnail must be produced 
if that functionality is supported.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

Control wordMeaning
\forceupgradeThis control word specifies that the contents of the document may be upgraded and that the 
resulting document shall not have its functionality limited to only those functions compatible 
with earlier word processing applications. The only action required as partof upgrading the 
document is the instantiation of the \nofeaturethrottle1and/or \nouicompatcontrol 
words. 
Note: At the time of Microsoft Office Word 2007 release, respecting this control word means 
that all compatibility options in the document that maintain compatibility with previous word 
processing applications shall be removed from the file or set to “0” with the exception of: 
\nospaceforul
\lnbrkrule
\noxlattoyen
\expshrtn
\dntultrlspc
\dntblnsbdbwid
\dontadjustlineheightintable
If an application does not know how to upgrade a document, this control word and the 
\nofeaturethrottleNand \nouicompatcontrol words should be ignored and persisted.
Note: The remaining operations that shall be performed as part of upgrading the document 
are application-defined and outside the scope of this specification. 
\noafcnsttblThis control word specifies whether applications shall allow tables to be resized to the 
remaining available line width when they are using the AutoFit algorithm, and part of that 
line is filled by a shape with a wrapping type of square or tight. 
Typically, a table that is AutoFit and has a preferred width shall have its width reduced to 
allow a floating shape to wrap around its contents within the document, as that shape
reduces the width of the line and the AutoFit algorithm applies to the remaining line width. 
This control word specifies that tables shall never have any preferred width overridden to 
allow them to wrap around that floating object, and shall instead be pushed to the next full 
width line in the document to be displayed.
Example: Consider an RTF document with a floating shape centered in the document, 
followed by a table with preferred cell widths of 2.22", as follows:
















The default presentation of this document overrides thepreferred cell widths to force the 
table to fit on the line next to the floating shape with tight wrapping.
However, if this compatibility setting’s parameter is “1” then that table is not resized, so it 
cannot fit and must be pushed to the next full width line, resulting in the following output:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

\felnbrelevThis control word specifies an alternate set of characters that may be used to determine that 
characters can begin or end a line when kinsoku line breaking rules are enabled.
Specifically, the following settings shall be used instead (for brevity, only those settings that 
are different than the default behavior of Microsoft Office Word 2007 are listed below):

Example: Consider a line of text in a WordprocessingML document within a paragraph 
marked as Chinese (Simplified) that begins with a % symbol, as follows:
%...
Typically, the kinsoku settings for Chinese (Simplified) do not allow this character to begin a 
line, so the character before that symbol would be moved down onto this line:
〖%...
However, if this compatibility setting is present, then the alternate kinsoku rules are in place, 
which do not prevent the % character from beginning the new line, resulting in the following 
output:
%...

\indrlswelevenThis control word specifies whether applications should ignore the presence of floating 
objects when calculating the starting position of paragraphs that are wrapped around floating 
objects defined using the Vector Mark-up Language (VML) syntax.
Typically a floating object on the same line or lines as a paragraph only affectsthe text when 
the floating object occurs where that text would normally be presented. 
Example: Text at a 1" indentation would only be displaced by a floating object that appears 
at that position and not one that appears from 0" to 0.5" on the same line.
This control word specifies that floating objects shall always impact paragraphs on the same \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

line in two ways:
1.If the paragraph is not numbered, then it shall tightly wrap any floating object that 
precedes it on the same line, ignoring its own indentation settings. 
Example: A paragraph with a 1" left indent shall tightly wrap a floating object that 
appearsat only 0.25" on the same line. 
2.If the paragraph is numbered, then it shall calculate and use its full indent relative 
to the edge of the floating object, not relative to the edge of the page. 
Example: A numbered paragraph with a 1" left indent shall appear 1.5" into the 
page if it is preceded by a floating object that appears at 0.5" on the same line. 
Example: Consider an RTF document with a narrow floating object at 0.5" on the page, 
surrounded by both numbered and unnumbered paragraphs.The default presentation would 
have no impact on the paragraphs based on that floating object, since the two do not 
intersect:

\nocxsptableThis control word specifies whether the suppression of additional space (contextual spacing) 
shall be applied to paragraphs contained withintables.
Typically, the rules for the removal of additional paragraph spacing are applied to all 
paragraphs in an RTF document. This control word specifies that this setting shall always be 
ignored for paragraphs in table cells (and additional spacing shall be allowed).
Example: Consider an RTF document with a default paragraph style with additional spacing 
after and contextual spacing set:
The default presentation would have the spacing suppressed between all paragraphs, since \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

\notcvaspThis control word specifies whether applications shall vertically align the contents of a table 
cell, even when the contents of that table cell include one or more floating objects defined 
using the Vector Mark-up Language syntax. Note that the floating object must be part of the 
cell, andnot displayed over the cell due to its anchoring relative to another part of the 
document.
Typically, if the alignment of a table cell in an RTF document is specified, then the entire 
contents of that cell are aligned as specified [Example: The entire contents of the cell are 
centered vertically and moved right-aligned horizontally at that point. End example]. 
This control word specifies that whenever a floating object defined usingVML is present in a 
table cell that no vertical alignment shall be applied to the contents of that cell, and the 
contents of the cell shall instead always be top aligned to the cell's contents.
Example: Consider an RTF table with two cells, each containing some text and a single shape 
defined using the Vector Mark-up Language syntax. The first cell is vertically aligned to the 
bottom of the cell, and the second cell is vertically aligned to the center of the cell.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

\spltpgparThis control word specifies whether a page break shall automatically complete the line on 
which it appears, moving the end of the paragraph to a new line on the next page, or if it 
shall behave as true run-level content within its current paragraph.
Typically, a page break is treated as run-level content,which means that although it delimits 
the end of the page, if there is no content after it within the current paragraph that the 
paragraph shall also end on that page. 
This control word specifies that a page break shall always immediately end the currentpage, 
moving the paragraph mark that delimits the end of its parent paragraph to a new line on 
the next page.
Note that this setting only affects the case where there is no run-level content after the page 
break within the paragraph –if any further run content appears in the paragraph it shall 
appear on subsequent lines on the next page.

page break as rendered by Microsoft Office Word 2007. \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

page break shall immediately end the first page, pushing the end of the first paragraph onto 
the first line of the second page, resulting in the following output:







Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003.
\hwelevThis control word specifies whether applications should assume that all characters in the 
Hangul Syllables Unicode sub range (character values between 0xAC00 and 0xD7FF) are of a 
single fixed width or shall use the characters’ widths defined by the font in use (typical for a 
proportional width font).
Typically, applications shall retrieve the character width for any character in a document 
from the associated font, allowing each character to be of its own width (a proportional width 
character). 
This control word specifies that applications shall instead assume a single fixed width for all 
characters in the Hangul Syllables sub range, by reading the width of Unicode character 
0x4E00 from the associated font and using that width for all Hangul characters (or, if that 
character is not present, the next available character in the font).
Example: Consider an RTF document with three Hangul characters:







The default presentation would have each of those characters using the widths defined by 
the font (the highlighting indicates that each character has its own width):


















However, if this control word is present, then all three characters are forced to the fixed 
width of character 0x4E00 from the font (or, in this case, the next available character), 
resulting in the characters in the font being forced to that fixed width, which results in the 
following output:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

single character and displayed at that fixed width. 
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003.
\afelevThis control word specifies that when performing an AutoFit on a table in an RTF document to 
display it, applications shall alter that logic slightly to mimic the behavior of a previous word 
processing application. Specifically, if the width of a grid column in a table has been set by a 
preferred tablecell width, then that column's width may be enlarged by the content of cells 
which themselves do not have a preferred width (in contrast, the normal logic never allows 
the content of cells to override a preferred width on a grid column).
\cachedcolbalThis control word specifies that cached paragraph information shall be used for column 
balancing. Specifically, this control word specifies that when a paragraph's lines have 
differing heights, an application shall treat this paragraph as though it had only one line 
equaling the full paragraph height, regardless of the actual number of lines in the paragraph.
Note: It is recommended that applications not intentionally replicate this behavior as it was 
deprecated due to issues with its output and is maintainedonly for compatibility with existing 
documents from a legacy application. 
Typically, lines are correctly measured for their height when balancing columns as part of an 
RTF document. This control word specifies that applications shall perform the incorrect 
calculation in the conditions described above.
Note: This control word is used to maintain compatibility with documents created by 
Microsoft Office Word 2003.
\utinlThis control word specifies whether applications shall underline the character following the 
numbering defined when both the numbering itself and the first letter of the corresponding 
numbered paragraph are underlined.
Typically, the tab or space character generated between numbering and the corresponding 
paragraph of text is never formatted, since it is automatically generated. This control word 
specifies that the tab or space shall be underlined the same way as the numbering symbol 
itself in the following conditions:
The numbering is underlined
The first character of the paragraph is underlined
Example: Consider an RTF document with two numbered paragraphs: one with underlined 
text and the other without. The default presentation would have the tab characters free of 
underlining in both cases:








However, if this control word is present, then the second paragraph meets the criteria 
defined above for having the suffix character underlined, resulting in the following output:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Document Properties

\notbrkcnstfrctbl This control word specifies whether applications shall allow a table row to be split in two 
when its contents are displayed under the following circumstances:
The table row exceeds one page in height (it must be split across two pages)
The tablerow would need to be split to accommodate a floating table also on the page
This control word, when present, specifies that table rows that exceed one page in height 
shall never be split around floating tables in the document, and shall instead be displayed on 
the first page below the floating table, even if that means that part of the table row is clipped 
by the edge of the page.
Example: Consider an RTF document with a long single table row that must be split across 
two separate pages in the document, toaccommodate a floating table anchored in the 
footer, as follows:

















The default presentation of this document forces that row to be split as needed around that 
floating table.
However, if this control word is present, then that table row is never split around the floating 
table, so it is always placed below that floating table on the page, and allowed to flow off the 
page as needed, resulting in the following output:

















This example, while extreme, shows how the row is placed below the floating table, rather
than breaking around it.

Mail Merge
Mail merge refers to an operation by which RTF documents work together with data from an 
external data source, importing the data into a document according to a set of codes that are 
contained in RTF tags that are also known as fields (\field). 

An RTF document that contains the \*\mailmerge control word is connected to an external data 
source. This document is known as a source document. In addition to being connected to an 
external data source and containing fields, a source document may contain any regular RTF 
constructs. These include the following: 
•Character text
•Paragraphs
•Images
•Tables
•Lists
The two key parts of the mail merge data that are stored in an RTF document: 
•The information that connects the documentto the external data source
•The information that populates the fields in the document with external data
Once the fields in a mail merge document have been populated with external data, the mail 
merge process is complete. The resulting files are knownas mail merged documents ormerged 
documents.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Mail Merge

These control words are described in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\*\mailmergeSpecifies all the mail merge information for a document that has been connected to an 
external data source as part of a mail merge operation.
\mmlinktoquerySpecifies that the current RTF document's query string, stored in the <mmquery> control 
word and used to specify the data to be imported from the external data source, actually 
contains a reference to an external query file that contains the actual query data to be used 
against the specified external data source for the mail merge. This query shall mimic a 
STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE query and be of the following form: SELECT * FROM 
<query file path>.

If this element is omitted, the query specified for the data source that is attached to the 
current document shall be assumed to not be a query that contains a link to an external file.
\mmdefaultsqlSpecifies if a given merged RTF document shall prompt its conforming hosting application to 
use the default STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE query string. The default STRUCTURED 
QUERY LANGUAGE query string for merged RTF documents is "SELECT * FROM 
<datasource>". 
\*\mmconnectstrdataSpecifies the hexadecimal-encoded connection string used to reconnect to an external data 
source.
\*\mmconnectstrDestination taking #PCDATA which has been replaced by \mmconnectstrdatabecause the 
connect string is very long and may be truncated.
\mmquerySpecifies the Structured Query Language string that shall be run against the specified 
external data source to return the set of records from the external data that shall be 
imported into merged RTF documents when the mail merge operation is performed. If this 
control word is omitted, no query shall be associated with the current data source.
\mmdatasourceSpecifies the location of the external data source to be connected to a given RTF document.
\mmheadersourceSpecifies the location of a file that contains the column header information that shall be 
used when connecting to an external data source that does not have column header data 
specified. Specifically, this control word specifies a file that corresponds with the external 
data source specified by the <mmdatasource> control word.

Note: Column headers are needed to enable a hosting application to associate an external 
data source's columns to fields via the <mmodsofldmpdata> control word.
\mmblanklinksSpecifies how an application performing the mail merge shall handle blank lines in the 
merged documents resulting from the mail merge. Typically, when a mail merge is 
performed, any blank lines that result from lines whose sole contents are merge fields with 
no content are removed from the merged document to prevent extraneous blank lines from 
appearing in the merged documents. When this control word is present, the merged 
documents that are generated from the mail merge shall not have any blank lines removed 
before they are sent to their destination format.

If this control word is omitted, the mergeddocuments that are generated from this mail 
merge shall have all blank lines suppressed if they consist of only merge fields with values 
that consist of empty strings.
\mmaddfieldnameSpecifies the column within a given external data source that containse-mail addresses. 
This control word is specified independently of the field mappings specified for a given 
merged document via the <mmodsofldmpdata> control word.

If this control word is omitted, or if no column exists in the data source with this column
name, the source document specifies that no e-mail address data shall be associated with 
this mail merge.

Note: This control word is generally used to allow you to send in e-mailmerged documents 
resulting from populating the fields within a merged document with external data.

This control word is independent of the field mapping that is specified for a given merged 
document via the <mmodsofldmpdata> control word. This separation enables applications 
to e-mail the documents resulting from the population of RTF fields with external data \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Mail Merge

Control wordMeaning
regardless of the presence or absence of a field mapped to external data specifying e-mail 
addresses.
\mmmailsubjectSpecifies the text that shall appear in the subject line of the e-mail messages or faxes that 
result after the actions of a mail merge have imported external data into fields within a 
merged RTF document whose destination is e-mail or fax as specified by the 
<mmdestemail> or <mmdestfax> control words.

If this control word is omitted, no subject line text shall be associated with each merged 
document produced via a mail merge using the specified mail merge data. If the 
<mmdestemail> or <mmdestfax> control words are not used, this control word shall be 
ignored.
\mmattachSpecifies that, after importing external data into fields to generate a series of destination 
RTF documents as e-mail messages, the resulting documents should be sentin e-mailed as 
an attachment rather than the body of the actual e-mail message.

If the <mmdestemail> control word is not present, this control word shall be ignored.
\mmshowdataSpecifies that a specific merged document shall display the data from the specified external 
data source where merge fields have been inserted. The <mmreccur> control word is used 
to specify the record within the external data source that is to have its applicable data 
displayed where applicable within the RTF merged document.

If the <mmreccur> control word is not present in the RTF for the document leveraging this 
control word, the hosting application may behave as if the <mmreccur> control word's 
parameter was equal to 1.
\mmreccurNSpecifies that the hosting application shall display the given record from the specified 
external data source in place of the fields to which its data is mapped via the 
<mmodsofldmpdata> control word in a merged document. When this control word is 
present, the parameter shall specify the one-based index of the record from that data 
source that shall be used to populate this document.

If the <mmreccur> control word is omittedwith the <mmshowdata> control word present, 
the hosting application shall behave as if the <mmreccur> control word’s parameter was 
equal to 1. If the <mmshowdata> control word is omitted, this control word shall be 
ignored. If the <mmreccur> control word’s parameter is less than 1 or greater than the 
number of records in the specified external data source, the hosting application shall treat 
this parameter as if it were equal to 1.
\mmerrorsNSpecifies the type of error reporting that shall be conducted by an application when 
performing a mail merge against the specified source data.

The type of error reporting implied by this control word shall be defined as follows: 


•Simulate the population of fields with mapped external data, and report errors in a new 
document if the parameter is equal to 1.


•While populating fields with mapped external data pause to report each error as it occurs if 
the parameter is equal to 2.


•Populate fields with mapped external data, and report errors in a new document if the 
parameter is equal to 3.


•If this control word is omitted, or if its parameter is set to a parameter outside those specified 
above, its parameter shall be assumed to be 2.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Mail Merge

Control wordMeaning
\*\mmodsoSpecifies a group of additional settings for the mail merge information included as part of 
the current document, the sum total of which is referred to as the Office Data Source Object 
(ODSO) settings for the mail merge.

If the <mmdatatypeodso> control word is not used, the settings that are specified within 
this controlword may be ignored in favor of their non-ODSO equivalents.
\*\mmodsoudldataSpecifies the Universal Data Link (UDL) connection string used to reconnect to an external 
data source. The destination specified by this control word shall contain the hexadecimal 
encoding of the connection string that the hosting application shall pass to a external data 
source access application to enable the RTF document to be reconnected to the specified 
external data source.

If this destination is omitted, no UDL connection string shall be associated with the ODSO 
data for this mail merge.

This connection string is only used under the following conditions: 


•The <mmdatatypeodso> control word is used in the given RTF file.


•The current application is able to use the ODSOinformation to access the data source.

\*\mmodsoudlDestination for #PCDATA replaced by \mmodsoudldatabecause Universal Data Link 
(UDL)string is verylong and suffers truncation
\mmodsotableSpecifies the particular set of data that a source or merged RTF document shall be 
connected to within an external data source that contains multiple data sets. In other 
words, when connecting an RTF document to an external data source that may have more 
than one repository of data within it, such as a database that has multiple tables or a 
spreadsheet that has multiple worksheets, this control word is used to distinguish the 
specific table or spreadsheet from which data will be imported from within the external data 
source.
\mmodsosrcSpecifies the location of the external data source to be connected to a given RTF document 
to perform the mail merge.

This control word is used to specify the location of the external data source only under the 
following conditions: 


•The <mmdatatypeodso> control word is used in the given RTF file.


•The current application is able to use the ODSO information to access the data source.

\*\mmodsofilterSpecifies the data records within the external data source that are to be included within the 
mail merge.

If the destination ofthis control word conflicts with the <mmodsoudldata> control word, the 
<mmodsoudldata> control word shall take precedence.
\*\mmodsosortSpecifies the order in which the data records within the external data source are to be 
included within the mail merge.

If the destination of this control word conflicts with the <mmodsoudldata> control word, the 
<mmodsoudldata> control word shall take precedence.
\*\mmodsofldmpdataSpecifies how a column specified in the external data source that has been connected toan 
RTF document shall be mapped to the fields (\field) within the given merged document's 
contents. Each instance of an <mmodsofldmpdata> control word contains the information 
that is needed to map one column in the external data source to a single type of field for 
the purposes of the mail merge in the current document.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Mail Merge

Control wordMeaning
\mmodsonameSpecifies the column name within a given external data source for the column whose index 
is specified via the <mmodsofmcolumn> control word. This data source name provides a 
column name that shall be used to map a specific field in the document, as specified by the 
<mmodsofldmpdata> control word. The parameter of this control word specifies the name 
of this column in the data source when the connection is initially established that is then 
used permanently to link columns in the database to fields in the document.

If this control word is omitted, no data source name is provided for the current column.
\mmodsomappednameSpecifies the predefined RTF field name that shall be mapped to the column number 
specified by the <mmodsofmcolumn> control word within an instance of the 
<mmodsofldmpdata>.

If the application does not have a predefined merge field whose name matches the name 
specified using the destination of this control word,this control word may be ignored.
\mmodsofmcolumnNSpecifies the zero-based index of the column within a given external data source that shall 
be mapped to the local name of a specific MERGEFIELD field specified by the parent field 
mapping data. The parameter specifies this index value, which is used to look up the 
appropriate column in the data source.

If this control word is omitted, or if its value exceeds the number of columns in the 
associated data source, the index of the referenced column shall beassumed to be 0.

columns within external data sources. The character representing the specific delimiter used 
for the external data source referenced by a source or merged RTF document is specified 
via a decimal number representing the decimal number for the Unicode character 
representation within this control word’s parameter.

If this control word is omitted, no column delimiter shall bespecified for the data source in 
this mail merge.
\mmjdsotypeNSpecifies the type of external data source to be connected to as part of the ODSO 
connection information for this mail merge. This setting is purely a suggestion of the data 
source type that is being used for this mail merge. This setting may be ignored in favor of 
an alternative mechanism if one is present.
\mmodsofhdrNSpecifies that a hosting application shall treat the first row of data in the specified external 
data source as a header row containing the names of each column in the data source, 
rather than data to populate mapped fields in a merged document.

the keywords defined for paragraph borders.
Headers and Footers
Headers and footers are RTF destinations. Each section in the document can have its own set of 
headers and footers. If no headers or footers are defined for a given section, the headers and 
footers from the previous section (if any) are used. Headers and footers have the following 
syntax:

<hdrftr>'{' <hdrctl> <para>+ '}' <hdrftr>?
<hdrctl>\header | \footer | \headerl | \headerr | \headerf | \footerl | \footerr | \footerf

Note: Each separate <hdrftr> group must have a distinct <hdrctl> introducingit.

Control wordMeaning
\headerHeader on all pages. This is a destination control word.
\footerFooter on all pages. This is a destination control word.
\headerlHeader on left pages only. This is a destination control word.
\headerrHeader on rightpages only. This is a destination control word.
\headerfHeader on first page only. This is a destination control word.
\footerlFooter on left pages only. This is a destination control word.
\footerrFooter on right pages only. This is a destination control word.
\footerfFooter on first page only. This is a destination control word.


Note: Prior to the Microsoft Word 2007, only the \footerkeyword and/or the \headerkeyword 
wer written if the "facing pages" (\facingp) option was disabled. Additionally, only the 
\headerland \headerrkeywords for the left and right headers, respectively, were written if 
the \facingpoption was enabled.With the release of the Microsoft Word 2007, the \headerl
keyword and the \headerrkeyword are always written. Additionally, the \headerrkeyword is 
written as the header on every page if the \facingpoption is disabled. 
The \headerl, \headerr, \footerl, and \footerrcontrol words are used in conjunction with 
the\facingpcontrol word, and the\headerfand \footerfcontrol words are used in 
conjunction with the\titlepgcontrol word. Many RTF readers will not function correctly if the 
appropriate document properties are not set. In particular, if \facingpis not set, then only 
\header and \footer canbe used, but \headerrand \footerrshould be used if \headerand 
\footerare missing.If \facingpis set, then only \headerl, \headerr, \footerl, and 
\footerrshould be used.Combining both \facingp and \titlepgis allowed. You should not use 
\headerto set the headers for both pages when \facingpis set. You can use \headerfif 
\titlepgis not set, but no header will appear. For more information, see Document Formatting 
Propertiesand Section Formatting Propertiesin this Specification.
If the previous section had a first page header or footer and had \titlepgset, and the current 
section doesnot, then the previous section’s first page header or footer is not used for the 
current section. However, it is not destroyed; if subsequent sections have \titlepgset, then the 
first page header or footer is restored.


Paragraph Text
There are two kinds of paragraphs: plainand table. A table is a collection of paragraphs. A table 
row is a contiguous series of paragraphs partitioned into cells.

Paragraph Formatting Properties
These control words (described as <parfmt> in the paragraph-text syntax description) specify 
generic paragraph formatting properties. These control words can appear anywhere in the body 
of the paragraph, not just at the beginning.

Note: If the \pardcontrol word is not present, the current paragraph inherits all paragraph properties from the 
previous paragraph.
The paragraph-formatting control words are listed in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\parNew paragraph.
\pardResets to default paragraph properties.
\spvStyle separator feature that causes the paragraph mark to not appear even in ShowAll. Used to 
nest paragraphs within thedocument view or outline without generating a new heading.
\hyphparSwitches automatic hyphenation for the paragraph.Append 1 or nothing to toggle property on; 
append 0 to turn it off.
\intblParagraph is part of a table.
\itapNParagraph nesting level, where 0 is the main document, 1 is a table cell, 2 is a nested table cell, 
3 is a doubly nested table cell, and so forth (default is 1).
\keepKeep paragraph intact(completely on one page if possible).
\keepnKeep paragraph with the next paragraph.
\levelNNis the outline level of the paragraph.
\nolineNo line numbering.
\nowidctlparNo widow/orphan control. This is a paragraph-level property and is used to override the 
document-level \widowctrl.
\widctlparWidow/orphan control is used for the current paragraph. This is a paragraph property used to 
override the absence of the document-level \widowctrl.
\outlinelevelNOutline level of paragraph. The N argument is a value from 0 to 8 representing the outline level 
of the paragraph. In the default case, no outline level is specified (same as body text).
\pagebbBreak page before the paragraph.
\sbysSide-by-side paragraphs.
\sNDesignates paragraph style. If a paragraph style is specified, style properties must be specified 
with the paragraph.Nreferences an entry in the style sheet.

Table Style Specific
\ytsNDesignates the table stylehandlethat was applied to the row/cell.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Paragraph Formatting

Control wordMeaning
\indmirror This control word specifies whether the paragraph indents should be interpreted as mirrored 
indents. When this control word is present, the left indent shall become the inside indent and the 
right indent shall become the outside indent.
If this control word is specified for this paragraph, then the inside page edge is the rightpage 
edge for odd numbered pages and the left page edge for even numbered pages. Conversely, the 
outside page edge is the left page edge for odd numbered pages and the right page edge for 
even numbered pages.
If this control word is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting 
previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (that is that previous setting remains 
unchanged). If this setting is never specified in the style hierarchy, then this property shall not 
be applied.

Spacing
\sbNSpace before in twips (default is0).
\saNSpace after in twips (default is0).
\sbautoNAuto spacing before:
0Space before determined by \sbN
1Space before is Auto (ignores \sbN)
Default is0.
\saautoNAuto spacing after:
0Space after determined by \saN
1Space after is Auto (ignores \saN)
Default is0.
\lisbNSpace before in hundredths of a character unit. Overrides \sbN, although they should both be 
emitted with equivalent values.
\lisaNSpace after in hundredths of a character unit. Overrides \saN, although they should both be 
emitted with equivalent values.
\slNSpace between lines. If this control word is missing or if \sl0is used, the line spacing is 
automatically determined by the tallest character in the line. If Nis a positive value, this size is 
used only if it is taller than the tallest character (otherwise, the tallest character is used); if Nis 
a negative value, the absolute value of Nis used, even if it is shorter than the tallest character.
\slmultNLine spacing multiple.Indicates that the current line spacing is a multiple of "Single" line spacing. 
This control word can follow only the \slNcontrol word and works in conjunction with it.
0"At Least" or "Exactly" line spacing
1Multiple line spacing, relative to "Single"
\nosnaplinegridDisable snap line to grid.
\contextualspaceThis control word specifies that any space specified before or after this paragraph should not be 
applied when the preceding and following paragraphs are of the same paragraph style, affecting 
the top and bottom spacing respectively. 
Example: This control word is typically used for paragraphs in lists, in which any space between 
subsequent list items, even if inherited from another style, is not desirable. 
If this control word is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting 
previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (that is that previous setting remains 
unchanged).
If this setting is never specified in the style hierarchy, then spacing is not ignored. If it is present, 
then the spacing above or below on this paragraph is subtracted from the spacing that would 
have been present if contextual spacing was not applied, never going below zero.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Paragraph Formatting

Tabs
Any paragraph may have its own set of tabs. Tabs must follow this syntax:

<tabdef>(<tab> | <bartab>)+
<tab><tabkind>? <tablead>? \txN
<bartab><tablead>? \tbN
<tabkind>\tqr| \tqc| \tqdec
<tablead>\tldot| \tlmdot| \tlhyph| \tlul| \tlth| \tleq


Control wordMeaning
\txNTab position in twips from the left margin.
\tqrFlush-right tab.
\tqcCentered tab.
\tqdecDecimal tab.
\tbNBar tab position in twips from the left margin.
\tldotLeader dots.
\tlmdotLeader middle dots.
\tlhyphLeader hyphens.
\tlulLeader underline.
\tlthLeader thick line.
\tleqLeader equal sign.


Absolute Postion Tabs
Thecontrol words given by <reltomargin> and <reltoindent> below specifythat an absolute 
position tab character be placed at the current location in the run content. An absolute position 
tab is a character that is used to advance the position on the current line of text when displaying 
RTF content independently ofcustom tab stops defined using the \tbNand\txNcontrol words. 
The resulting end position of the tab character isnot affected by the addition of custom tab 
stops or changes to the value of the \deftabNcontrol word. Absolute position tabs are defined 
to be adjusted left, center, or right relative to either the starting (in LTR paragraphs, left) 
margin or the starting indent.They are useful in headers and footers.
If the alignment location specified by the positional tab cannot be found on the current line, 
because the starting location is past that point, then the tab character shall advance to that 
location on the next available line in the document.
The syntax for absolute positiontabs is:

<ptab>'{' <ptableadding>?<relto>'}'
<ptableadding> \ptablnone |\ptabldot |\ptablminus |\ptabluscore |\ptablmdot
<relto><reltomargin> | <reltoindent>
<reltomargin> \pmartabql |\pmartabqc |\pmartabqr 
<reltoindend> \pindtabql |\pindtabqc |\pindtabqr


For example, here is the RTF specifying an absolute position “flushright” tab with leading dots 
between the leftindentand the absolute tab:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Paragraph Formatting

Bullets and Numbering

Word 6.0 and Word 95 RTF
To provide compatibility with existing RTF readers, all applications that can automatically format 
paragraphs with bullets or numbers will also emit the generated text as plain text in the
\pntextgroup. This allows existing RTF readers to capture the plain text and safely ignore the 
auto number instructions. This group precedes all bulleted or numbered paragraphs, and 
contains all the automatically generated text and formatting. It should precede the '{\*' \pn
…'}'destination, and it isthe responsibility of RTF readers that understand the '{\*'\pn…'}'
destination to ignore the \pntext group. The following table defines the grammar of this group.

Word 97 through Word 2007RTF
Each paragraph that is part of a list must contain some keyword to indicate the list that it is in, 
and the level of the list it belongs to. Word 97 through Word 2007 also provide the flat text 
representation of each number (in the \listtextdestination); so, RTF readers that do not 
understand Word 97 numbering will get the paragraph number, along with appropriate character 
properties, inserted into their document at the beginning of the paragraph. Any RTF reader that 
does understand Word 97 through Word 2007 numbering should ignore the entire \listtext
destination.

Control wordMeaning
\lsNShould exactly match the \lsNfor one of the list overrides in the List Override table.
\ilvlNThe 0-based level of the list to which the paragraph belongs. For all simple lists, Nshould always 
be 0. For multilevel lists, it can be 0 through 8.The value 9 is never used. The values 10 through 
12 have the special meaningsfor documents generated by Word 6: 10 = ilvlBullet (a bulleted 
paragraph in Word 6), 11 = ilvlList (a numbered paragraph in Word 6), 12 = ilvlContinue (a 
paragraph that was not itself numbered, but took its indenting scheme from its numbering 
properties and did not “break” numbering (that in Word 6 required otherwise contiguous 
paragraphs).
\listtextContains the flat text representation(<char>)of the number, including character properties. 
Should be ignored by any reader that understands Word 97 through Word 2007 numbering. This 
is a destination control word.


Revision Marks for Paragraph Numbers and ListNum Fields
Paragraph numbers and ListNum fields track revision information with special properties applied 
to the paragraph mark and ListNum field, respectively. The special properties hold the "old" 
value of the number—the value it held when revision-mark tracking began. At display time, 
Word checks the number's current value and compares it with this "old" value to determine 
whether it has changed. If the numbers are different, the old value shows up as deleted and the 
new value as inserted. If the numbers are the same, Word displays the new value normally, with 
no revision information. If there isno old value, the new value shows up as inserted. The 
following table lists the RTF specifications for these special properties.

Control wordMeaning
\pnrauthNIndex into the revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to 
be the author of that revision. 
NoteThis keyword is used to indicate paragraph number revisions.
\pnrdateNTime of the revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.
\pnrnotIndicates whether the paragraph number for the current paragraphis marked as "inserted."
\pnrxstNThe keywords \pnrxstN, \pnrrgbN, \pnrpnbrN, and \pnrnfcNdescribe the "deleted number" 
text for the paragraph number. Their values are binary. Each of these keywords is represented as 
an array. The deleted number is written out with a \pnrstartNkeyword, followed by the array’s 
keyword, followed by the first byte of the array, followed by the array’s keyword, followed by the 
second byte of the array’s keyword, followed by the array’s keyword, followed by the third byte of
the array’s keyword, and so on. Some arrays contain 16-bit (32-bit) quantities, but each array 
keyword only takes a byte value, so two (four) array keywords are needed to represent a single 
quantity in these cases. This sequence is followed by the \pnrstopNkeyword.
\pnrxstNis a 32-item Unicode character array (twobytes for each character) with a length byte 
as the first number—it has the actual text of the number, with "level" place holders written out as 
digits from 0 through 8.
\pnrrgbNNine-item array of indices of the level place holders in the\pnrxstNarray.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Paragraph Formatting

\pnrnfcNNine-item array containing the number format codes of each level (using the same values as the 
\levelnfcNkeyword). The number format code is represented as a short integer. 
\pnrpnbrNNine-item array of the actual values of the number in each level. The number is represented as a 
long integer.
\pnrstartNThe \pnrxstN,\pnrrgbN,\pnrpnbrN, and \pnrnfcNarrays are each preceded by the 
\pnrstartNkeyword, whose argument is 0 through 3, respectively, depending on the array.
\pnrstopNThe \pnrxstN,\pnrrgbN,\pnrpnbrN, and\pnrnfcNarrays are each terminated by the 
\pnrstopNkeyword, whose argument is the number of bytes written out in the array.


Example: Let’s take an example of the number "3-4b",which represents the third level of the 
list. The following table lists the values of each array.

pnrrgb\'01\'03\'04The level place holders are at indices 1, 3, and 4 in the string.The remainingsix unused 
levels should be emitted as index 0.
pnrnfc\'00\'00\'04The nfc values are Arabic (0), Arabic (0), and lowercase letter (4).The remaining six

Positioned Objects and Frames
The following paragraph-formatting control words specify the location of a paragraph on the 
page. Consecutive paragraphs with the same frame formatting are considered part of the same

separated by a paragraph with different or no frame information.

Note: if any paragraph in a table row has any of these control words specified, then all paragraphs in the table row 
must have the same control words specified, either by inheriting the properties from the previous paragraph or by 
re-specifying the controls.

Table Definitions
There is no RTF table group; instead, tables are specified as paragraph properties. A table is 
represented as a sequence of table rows. A table row is a contiguous series of paragraphs 
partitioned into cells. The table row begins with the \trowdcontrol word and ends with the 
\rowcontrol word. Every paragraph that is contained in a table row must have the \intbl
control word specified or inherited from the previous paragraph. A cell may have more than one 
paragraph in it; the cell is terminated by acell mark (the \cellcontrol word), and the row is 
terminated by a row mark (the \rowcontrol word). Table rows can also be positioned. In this 
case, every paragraph in a table row must have the same positioning controls (see the <apoctl> 
controls on the Positioned Objects and Framessubsection of this Specification. Table properties 
may be inherited from the previous row; therefore, a series of table rows may be introduced by

An RTF table row has the following syntax, as shown in the general paragraph-text syntax 
shown in the Paragraph Textsection of this Specification:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Tables

Note: While Word 97 emitted the row properties (<tbldef>) at the beginning of the row, a reader should not 
assume that this is the case. Properties can be emitted at the end, and, in fact, Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 
2007 do this. To avoid breaking readers that might make the aforementioned assumption, Word 2002, Word 2003, 
and Word 2007 will write a copy at the beginning as well, so the properties of a typical row in a Word 2002, Word 
2003, or Word 2007 document arerepeated at the beginning and at the end of the row. Note that for nested cells, 
Word 2002, Word 2003, and Word 2007 write the properties atthe end only.

\tblindNThis element, along with\tblindtypeN, specifies the indentation that shall be added before the 
leading edge of the current table in the document (the left edge in a left-to-right table, and the 
right edge in a right-to-left table). This indentation should shift the table into the text margin by 
the specified amount. 
This value specified corresponds to the unit of measurement specified by the \tblindtypeN 
control word. 
If this control word is omitted, then its value shall be assumed to be 0.
\tblindtypeNThis element, along with \tblindNspecifies the indentation that shall be added before the 
leading edge of the current table in the document (the left edge in a left-to-right table, and the 
right edge in a right-to-left table). This indentation should shift the table into the text margin by 
the specified amount. 
This control word specifies the units of measurement that shall be used in conjunction with the 
value of \tblindN. Any width value greater than 3 or less than 0 for this element shall be 
ignored.
If this attribute is omitted, then its value shall be assumed to be 1 (twentieths of a point).
ValueDescription
0 –auto (Automatically Determined Width)Specifies that the value for the measurement 
of the current table width property in the 
parent table shall be automatically
determined by the table layout algorithm 
when the table is displayed (this width can be 
adjusted as appropriate).


If this value is inappropriate for the current 
measurement (that is this measurement is 
not affected by that algorithm), then this type 
and the associated value may be ignored.
1 –dxa (Width in Twentieths of a Point)Specifies that the value for the measurement 
of the current table width property in the 
parent table shall be interpreted as twentieths 
of a point (1/1440 of an inch).
2 –nil (No Width)Specifies that the current width is zero, 
regardless of any width value specified on the 
parent element.
3 –pct (Width in Fiftieths of a Percent)Specifies that the value for the measurement 
of the current table width property in the 
parent table shall be interpreted as fiftieths of 
a percent.
If this value is inappropriate for the current 
measurement (that is this measurement is 
not part of the width of the table), then this 
type and the associated value may be 
ignored.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Tables

\clhidemarkThis control word specifies whether the end of cell glyph shall influence the height of the given 
table row in the table. If it is specified, then only printing characters in this cell shall be used to 
determine the row height.
Note: Typically, the height of a table row is determined by the height of all glyphs in all cells in 
that row, including the non-printing end of cell glyph characters. However, if these characters are 
not formatted, they are always created with the document default style properties. This means 
that the height of a table row cannot ever be reduced belowthe size of the end of cell marker 
glyph without manually formatting each paragraph in that run. 
In a typical document, this behavior is desirable as it prevents table rows from ‘disappearing’if 
they have no content. However, if a table row is being used as a border (for example, by shading 
its cells or putting an image in them), then this behavior makes it impossible to have a virtual 
border that is reasonably small without formatting each cell’s content directly. This setting 
specifies that the end of cell glyph shall be ignored for this cell, allowing it to collapse to the 
height of its contents without formatting each cell’s end of cell marker, which would have the side 
effect of formatting any text ever entered into that cell. 
If this control word is omitted, then the end of cell marker shall be included in the determination 
of the height of this row.
Example: Consider the following RTF table:






Notice that the only printing content in this table row is displayed using 5 point font, yet the row 
height is influenced by the end of cell markers in the empty cells.
If each cell in the second row in this table was set to exclude the table cell from this calculation, 
using the following RTF: \clhidemark, the resulting table shall exclude the cell markers from the 
row height calculation:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Tables

Control wordMeaning





The \clhidemarkcontrol word specified that each cell marker was excluded, resulting in the row 
height being defined by the actual run contents. 

Compared Table Cells
\clinsTable cell should be treated as though it was inserted into the ‘compared document’ that resulted 
from a document compare.
\cldel Table cell should be treated as though it was deleted from the ‘compared document’ that resulted 
from a document compare. This means that although the table cell control word exists in the 
structure of the table, the table cell technically no longer exists in the document.
\clmrgd Specifies vertical merge setting that was applied to the given table cell during a document 
compare; specifically, that this cell was merged with the cell above it in the ‘compared 
document’. 
\clmrgdr Specifies vertical merge setting that was applied to the given table cell during a document 
compare; specifically, that this cell wasmerged with the cell below it in the ‘compared document’. 
\clsplit Specifies vertical merge setting that was applied to the given table cell during a document 
compare; specifically, that this cell was split from the cell above it in the ‘compared document’.

\clsplitr Specifies vertical merge setting that was applied to the given table cell during a document 
compare; specifically, that this cell was split with the cell below it in the ‘compared document’. 
\clinsauthN Specifies author for a table cell insertion (\clins) within an RTF document.

If this control word is omitted, then no author shall be associated with the annotation.
\clinsdttmN Specifies date information for a table cell insertion (\clins) within an RTF document.

If this control word is omitted, then no date information shall be associated with the annotation.
\cldelauthNSpecifies author for a table cell deletion (\cldel) within an RTF document.

If this control word is omitted, then no author shall be associated with the annotation.
\cldeldttmNSpecifies date information for a table cell deletion (\cldel) within an RTF document.

If this control word is omitted, then no date information shall be associated with the annotation.
\clmrgdauthNSpecifies author for a table cell merge (\clmrgd, \clmrgdr, \clsplit, \clsplitr) within an RTF 
document.
If this control word is omitted, then no author information shall be associated with the

Example
The following is an example of a complex Word 2000 tablecreated from RTF. It does not take 
accountofthe table styles implemented in Word 2002, Word 2003, or Word 2007. The bitmap 
showing the table’s formatting is followed by the actual RTF used to create it. Following this 
example display of RTF is an analysis of the control words and values used to create the table.
The image shows a freely positioned Word table, with two cells atan offset. Inside the topmost 
cell is a nested table. The table has green borders, yellow shading, a small amount of spacing 
between cells, and inner cell margins or padding.
























The followingRTF was emitted by Word 2000. Word 2000 also emits RTF that older readers 
(such as previous versions of Word) can understand, so new features degrade nicely.

Nested cell ends with a \nestcell and is followed by a paragraph mark inside a \nonesttables 
destination, which is only read by readers that do not understand nested tables. This way the text in 
the nested table is in its own paragraph.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Tables

Table Styles Example


















Here is the style sheet with one table style highlighted. Note that a single table style can have 
multiple entries. 
\ts11 is the default table style. This style gives the first row a fill color and font attributes. 
Every subsequentodd row is filled with pale yellow.

Mathematics
This section discusses the Microsoft Office Word 2007 math RTF control words. These control 
words mirror the Office Open XML Math elements(OMML, see Office OpenXML, Section 7.1), 
only they are written with RTF syntax. Because of this, the Office Open XML specification can be 
referenced for further math information. For example in OMML, the built-up skewed fraction 
can berepresented by(leaving out parent math zone elements):

<m:f> 
<m:fPr>
<m:typem:val="skw"/>
</m:fPr>
<m:num>
<m:r>a</m:r>
</m:num>
<m:den>
<m:r>b</m:r>
</m:den>
</m:f>


In RTF, this can be represented as:

{\mf{\mfPr{\mctrlPr}{\mtype skw}}

{\mnum\u-10187?\u-9138?}

{\mden\u-10187?\u-9137?}}


The math object’s properties group must be included, here {\mfPr…}, including the {\mctrlPr}
even if the latter is empty if you want the text to inherit ambient character formatting. 
Word generally does notwrite surrogate pairs for Unicode math alphanumerics like and , but 
they work and they’re simpler to use since they’re used internally for most math variables. 
Instead, Word writes {\mr\mscr0\msty2 a}for the math italic a (U+1D44E) in the numerator of 
the fraction above and {\mr\mscr0\msty2 b}for the math italic b (U+1D44F) in the 
denominator. Surrogate pairs like \u-10187?\u-9138?must appear inside math object groups 
as in this example, or inside a math text-run group {\mr…}if not inside a math object. 
Math information is collected into two areas: 
1.Document default math properties in the {\mmathPr…}group
2.Math zones in {\mmath…} groups
A math zoneis a text range within which math typography rules usually applyand outside of 
which math typography rules donot apply. Math zones can contain specially marked normal text \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Mathematics

runsfor which math typography rules don’t apply (see \mnor). With Office math, math zones 
are identified internally by a character-format effect bit like bold. Hence if you delete the 
ordinary text separating two math zones, you get a single merged math zone.
Math zones can be inlineor display, corresponding to TeX’s $ and $$ togglekeys. If a math zone 
fills an entire paragraph, it is adisplay math zone, i.e., it is displayed on its own line(s). If a 
math zoneis preceded and/or followed bynonmath textother than a \par, the math zone is 
inlineand is rendered in a more compressed fashion. Inline math zones usually consist of math 
expressions or variables, whereas display math zones usually consist of one or more equations 
or formulas.
The RTF for the content of an inline math zone replaces the first ellipsis of the nested group 
structure

{\mmath {\*\moMath…}{\mmathPict…}}
Readers that do notunderstand the ignorable {\*\moMath…}group can use one of the pictures 
in the {\mmathPict…}group. 
The RTF for the content of adisplay math zone replaces the second ellipsis in the nested group 
structure

{\mmath{\*\moMathPara{\moMathParaPr…}{\*\moMath…}+}{\mmathPict…}}
Herethe + means that a{\*\moMath…} group isemittedfor each instance of mathematical text 
that shouldstartona new line, e.g., for each new equation. The control word \moMathPara
stands for a “math paragraph”, which can containmultiple equations with various alignment and 
breaking options. A math paragraph may be part of a text paragraph (text ending in a \parand 
either starting a document or following a \par). In general, a text paragraph can contain 
multiplemath paragraphs separated from one another by lines of normal text.
In this discussion, we see that math RTF uses two ways to assign property values depending on 
the property: 1) the standard RTF way with a parameter Nas in\msty2, and 2) using a mini 
group like {\mtype skw}. The latterway is inspired from the corresponding OMML syntax, such 
as<m:type m:val="skw"/>, while the RTF way is more succinct. As usual in this document, 
control words that take a parameter Nare displayed with a trailing Nin the following detailed 
definitions.

Control wordMeaning
\maccAccent object, consisting of a base and a combining diacritical mark.
\maccPrAccent object properties group
\malnAlignment property on box object, utilized only when box is designated as an operator 
emulator. When true, this operator emulator serves as an alignment point; that is, 
designated alignment points in other equations can be aligned with it.
\malnScrAlignment of scripts in subscript/superscript object. When on(resulting from {\malnScr 
on}), subscripts and superscripts are aligned to eachother. When off, they are kerned to 
the shape of the base. If this control word is omitted, scripts are not aligned. 
Example: (off): (on): 

\margPrMath argument properties group
\margSzSize, or script level, of an argument.For example, {\margSz 1}requests the next 
larger size (next smaller script level). Only text, script, and scriptscript sizes are 
available.This appears in the subscript object in contrast to the usual .

\mbegChrBeginning, or opening, delimiter character. Mathematical delimiters are enclosing 
characters such as parentheses, brackets, and braces. If this control word is omitted, the 
default \mbegChris'('. 
The expressionuses {and} as its enclosing charactersas specified by the RTF 
{\mbegChr \{}{\mendChr \}}.
\mborderBoxBorder Box object, consisting of a border drawn around an equation
\mborderBoxPrBorder Box object properties group; specifies the properties of the \mborderBoxobject, 
which dictate the types of lines that can be drawn as part of the border. 

Example:(Diagonal Strikethrough from Upper left) 

and
(no left or right edges)

\mboxBox object, used to group components of an equation.
\mboxPrBox object properties group; specifies properties of the \mboxfunction, for example, 
whether the \mboxserves as operator emulator with or without an alignment point, 
serves as a line breakpoint, or receives the correct spacing for the mathematical 
differential.
\mbrkNSpecifies whether a line break occurs in a display math zone at start of \mboxor \mr
object such that the line wraps at the start of the run or function. If this control word is 
omitted, a manual break is not inserted. The line may happen to wrap at this point if the 
equation exceeds the column width. The break aligns to the (N+ 1)st operator on the 
first line of the math zone.
Example: The following example hasa manual line break \mbrk1for the run containing
the third minus sign:





\mbrkBinNDocument property specifying how binary operators are treated when they coincide with 
a line break.
If this control word is omittedor N = 0, the line break occurs before the binary operator. 
That is, the binary operator is the first control word on the wrapped line. If N= 1, the 
line break occurs after the operator. If N= 2, the operator is duplicated, that is, it 
appears at the end of the first line and at the start of the second (see \mbrkBinSubN
for an enhancement of this kind of break).
Example:



BeforeAfterDuplicate

\mbrkBinSubNDocument property specifying how a subtraction operator is treated when it coincides 
with a line break when \mbrkBinNis set to duplicate. If this control word is omittedor N
= 0, the appears before and after the break. If N= 1, + appears before the break and 
after the break. If N= 2, appears before the break and + after the break.

\mvertJcAlong with \mposof \mgroupChrPr, specifies the vertical layout of the \mgroupChr
object. Where \mposspecifies the position of the grouping character, \mvertJc
specifies the alignment of the object with respect to the baseline. 
For example, when the group character is above the object, \mvertJcof top signifies 
that the top of the object falls on the baseline; when \mvertJcis set to bot, the bottom 
of the object is on the baseline. The table below demonstrates the four possible

To read negative \expndNvalues from Macintosh Word 5.1 (1992) and earlier, an RTF reader 
should use only the low-order 6 bits of the value read. These versionsdonot emit negative 
values for \expndN. Instead, theytreat values from 57 through 63 as –7 through –1, 
respectively (the low-order 6 bits of 57 through 63 are the same as –7 through –1).MacWord 
6.0 on wasbased on the Word for Windows and interprets \expndN the same way. 
Character Borders and Shading
Character shading has the following syntax:
<chshading>(\chshdngN| <pat>) \chcfpatN? \chcbpatN?
<pat>\chbghoriz |\chbgvert |\chbgfdiag |\chbgbdiag |\chbgcross |\chbgdcross |

Character Revision MarkProperties
These propertieshave the syntax and control words defined by

<chrev>\revised? \revauthN? \revdttmN? \crauthN? \crdateN? \deleted? \revauthdelN? 
\revdttmdelN? \mvf? \mvt? \mvauthN? \mvdateN?



Control wordMeaning
Track Changes (Revision Mark) Properties
\deletedText has been deleted since revision marking was turned on.
\revisedText has been added since revision marking was turned on.
\crauthNIndex into revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that revision. 
NoteThis keyword is used to indicate formatting revisions, such as bold, italic. 
\crdateNTime of revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.
\revauthNIndex into revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that revision.
\revdttmNTime of revision. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.
\revauthdelNIndex into revision table. The content of the Nth group in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that deletion. 
\revdttmdelNTime of deletion. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.
\mvfText has been moved to another location (is part of a “Move From”) since revision marking was 
turned on. This is only valid inside a “Move From” bookmark (see \mvfmfand \mvfml). 
Note: Deletion keywords (\deleted, \revauthdelN) are emitted as well so that move-unaware 
applications can understand the revision as a deletion. These keywords can be ignored by moveaware applications. 
\mvtText has been moved from another location (is part of a “Move To”) since revision marking was 
turned on. This is only valid inside a “Move To” bookmark (see \mvtofand \mvtol).
Note: Insertion keywords (\revised, \revauthN) are emitted as well so that move-unaware 
applications can understand the revision as an insertion. These auxiliary keywords can be ignored 
by move-aware applications.
\mvauthNIndex into revision table. The contents of the Nthgroup in the revision table is considered to be 
the author of that move.
\mvdateNTime of move. The 32-bit DTTM structure is emitted as a long integer.


Associated Character Properties
Bidirectional-aware text processors often need to associate a Latin (or other left-to-right) font 
with an Arabic or Hebrew (or other right-to-left) font. The association is needed to match 
commonly used pairs of fonts in name, size, and other attributes. Although RTF defines a broad 
variety of associated character properties, any implementation may choose not to implement a 
particular associated character property and share the property between the Latin and Arabic 
fonts. 
South Asian (complex script) runs of text share associated properties with right-to-left runs, but 
they are considered left-to-right. \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Character Formatting

Property association uses the following syntax:



<atext><ltrrun> | <rtlrun> | <sarun> | <nonsarun> | <saltrrun> | <nonsaltrrun> | 
<nonsartlrun> | <losbrun> | <hisbrun> | <dbrun>

The following are some examples of property association. The first example is a right-to-left run. 
Text will use the default bidirectional font, and will be underlined. The left-to-right font 
associated with this run is font 2 (in the font table) with bold and underlining.

\ltrch\af2\ab\au\rtlch\u Sample Text
The next example is a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font and the left-to-right font use the 
default font (specified by \deffN).

\plain\rtlch\ltrch Sample Text 
The following exampleis a left-to-right run. The right-to-left font is font 5, bold and italic. The 
left-to-right font is the default font, underlined. If the reader does not support underlining in the 
associated font, both fonts will be underlined.

\rtlch\af5\ab\ai\ltrch\u Sample Text
The property association control words (described as <aprops> in the syntax description) are 
listed in the following table. Some control words (indicated in the table by an asterisk following 
the description) can be turned off by appending 0 to the control word.

Highlighting
This property applies highlighting to text. The formatting is not a character format, so it cannot 
be part of a style definition.

Control wordMeaning
\highlightNHighlights the specified text. Nspecifies the color as an index of the color table.


Special Characters
The RTF Specification includes control words for special characters (described as<spec> in the 
character-text syntax description). If a special-character control word is not recognized by the 
RTF reader, it is ignored and the text following it is considered plain text. The RTF Specification 
is flexible enough to allow new special characters to be added for interchange with other 
software.
The special RTF characters are listed in the following table(<spec> is any one of these).

Control wordMeaning
\chdateCurrent date (as in headers).
\chdplCurrent date in long format (for example,Wednesday, February 20, 2008).

regular space.
\enspaceNonbreaking space equal to width of character “n”in current font. Some oldRTF writers use the 
construct '{'\enspace'}'(with two spaces before the closing brace) to trick readers unaware

Control wordMeaning
\rtlmarkThe following characters should be displayed from rightto left; usually found at the start of 
\rtlchruns.
\zwboZero-width break opportunity. Used to insert break opportunity between two characters.
\zwnboZero-width non-break opportunity. Used to remove break opportunity between two characters.
\zwjZero-width joiner. This is used for ligating (joining) characters.
\zwnjZero-width nonjoiner. This is used for unligating a character. 


A carriage return (character value 13) or line feed(character value 10) is treated as a \par
control if the character is preceded by a backslash. You must include the backslash; otherwise, 
RTF ignores the control word. (You may also want to insert a carriage-return/line feedpair 
without backslashes at least every 255 characters for better text transmission over 
communication lines.)
A tab (character value 9) should be treated as a \tab control word. Not all RTF readers 
understand this; therefore, an RTF writer should always emit the control word for tabs.
The following are the code values for the special characters listed.

Document Variables
Document variables are definable and accessed through macros. Document variables have the 
following syntax:

<variables>'{\*'\docvar '{'<varname> '}{'<vartext> '}}'
<varname>#PCDATA
<vartext>#PCDATA


The control word is described in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\docvarA group that defines a document variable name and its value.

Bookmarks
This destination may specify one of two control words: \*\bkmkstart, which indicates the start 
of the specified bookmark, and \*\bkmkend, which indicates the end of the specified 
bookmark.
Bookmarks have the following syntax:

<bookmark><bookstart> | <bookend>
<bookstart>'{\*'\bkmkstart(\bkmkcolfN? & \bkmkcollN?) #PCDATA '}'
<bookend>'{\*'\bkmkend#PCDATA '}'


A bookmark is shown in the following example:

\pard\plain \fs20 Kuhn believes that science, rather than 

discovering in experience certain structured 

relationships, actually creates (or already participates in) 

a presupposed structure to which it fits the data. 

{\bkmkstart paradigm} Kuhn calls such a presupposed 

structure a paradigm.{\bkmkend paradigm}
The bookmark start and end are matched with the bookmark tag. In this example, the 
bookmark tag is “paradigm”.Each bookmark start should have a matching bookmark end; 
however, the bookmark start and the bookmark end may be in any order.
\bkmkcolfN is used to denote the first column of a table covered by a bookmark. If it is not 
included, the first column is assumed. \bkmkcollNis used to denote the last column. If it is not 
used, the last column is assumed. These controls are used within the \*\bkmkstart
destination following the \bkmkstartcontrol. For example, {\*\bkmkstart\bkmkcolf2\bkmkcoll5 
Table1}places the bookmark “Table1”in columns 2 through 5 of a table.
Move Bookmarks
Movebookmarks provide an additional mechanism for revision tracking and behave in a similar, 
but more complex, fashion with respectto insertions(\revised)and deletions (\deleted).\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Character Formatting

Specifically, unlike insertions and deletions, which only use character properties to mark a text 
run as inserted or deleted, movebookmarks use a combination of character properties and
bookmarks. Character properties are used in the same way as in insertions and deletions –text 
is just marked to indicate that it has been moved.
Bookmarks, on the other hand, are used to signify where within the document the move is. This 
is needed because moved text may be edited; newly inserted or deleted2text, although within a 
move location, does not have the character properties for a move as it wasnot part of the 
original move. Newly typed text, for example, will either be marked through its character 
properties as an insertion (if you have “Track Changes” enabled) ornot at all (if changes are not 
being tracked).
In short, bookmarks are used to determine where the move location is, and character properties 
are used to mark specific text runs as being part of the move.
Move bookmarks are just two different kinds of bookmarks indicating the source and the 
destination of a move, respectively. The move’s source and destination bookmarks are matched 
by their unique tag (the same one that is used for matching the start and the end of the 
bookmark), and also contain move-specific information describing the author and date of a 
move.
\*\mvfmfand \*\mvtofsignify the start of a “Move From” or “Move To” bookmark, 
respectively. They indicate the move bookmark’s unique tag3anda hex-encoded structure 
describing the author and date/time of the revision.
\*\mvfmland \*\mvtolsignify the end of a “Move From” or “Move To” bookmark, 
respectively. They indicate the move bookmark’s unique tag so that they can be matched to 
their corresponding bookmark start control words.
Move bookmark syntax is:
<movebook><movebookstart> | <movebookend>
<movebookstart>'{\*'(\mvfmf| \mvtof) #PCDATA #SDATA '}'
<movebookend>'{\*'(\mvfml| \mvtol) #PCDATA '}'


As with normal bookmarks, the #PCDATA represents a unique tag for matching the start and the 
end of a bookmark, and, in moves, the source and destination locations. #SDATA represents a 
6-byte structure containing the move author (the first two bytes, little-endian representation; 
corresponds to the same value as the one used with the \mvauthNcontrol word) and the 
date/time of the move (see the DTTM bit field structure).
The following is a sample of move tracking within an RTF file:

{\*\mvfmf move148856603 0100768baa46} <Move source’s contents> {\*\mvfml move148856603}

{\*\mvtof move148856603 0100768baa46} <Move destination’s contents> {\*\mvtol move148856603}
















2Text can be deleted from a “Move To” location.


3Word generates “moveN”, where Nis a unique number, but any alphanumeric string not longer than twenty characters 

is valid.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Character Formatting

Control wordMeaning
\*\mvfmfSignifies the start of a “Move From” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control 
word with the corresponding end of the “Move From” bookmark (\mvfml)in the document and 
with the corresponding “Move To” bookmark (\mvtofand \mvtol).
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word:
If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvfmlcontrol word with a 
matching tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move From” bookmark exists.
If this control word and its corresponding bookmark end control word (\mvfml) occur 
without a matching “Move To” bookmark (\mvtofand \mvtol), then moved content in 
this move location shall be treated as if it has been marked as deleted instead of moved.
The control word and the bookmark tag are followed by the binary representation of a 6-byte 
structure containing the move author (the first two bytes, little-endian representation; 
corresponds to the same value as the one used with the \mvauthNcontrol word) and the 
date/time of the move (see the DTTM bit field structure). 
For example, in the RTF fragment below, 0100768baa46specifies 0x0001 for the author and 
0x46aa8b76 for the date/time, which corresponds to Tue 2006-10-17 13:54).

{\*\mvfmf move148856603 0100768baa46} 
\*\mvfmlSignifies the end of a “Move From” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control 
word with the corresponding start of the “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmf)in the document and 
with the corresponding “Move To” bookmark (\mvtofand \mvtol).
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word:
If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvfmfcontrol word with a 
matching tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move From” bookmark exists.
If this control word and its corresponding bookmark start control word occur without a 
matching “Move To” bookmark (\mvtofand \mvtol), then moved content in this move 
location shall be treated as if it has been deleted instead of moved.
\*\mvtofSignifies the start of the “Move To” bookmark. The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control 
word with the corresponding end of the “Move To” bookmark (\mvtol) in the document and with 
the corresponding “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmfand \mvfml).
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word
If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvtolcontrol word with a matching 
tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move To” bookmark exists.
If this control word and its corresponding bookmark end control word occur without a 
matching “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmfand \mvfml), then moved content in this 
move location shall be treated as if it has been marked as inserted instead of moved.
The controlword and the bookmark tag are followed by the binary representation of a 6-byte 
structure containing the move author (the first two bytes, little-endian representation; 
corresponds to the same value as the one used with the \mvauthNcontrol word) and the 
date/time of the move (see the DTTM bit field structure). 
For example, in the RTF fragment below, 0100768baa46specifies 0x0001 for the author and 
0x46aa8b76 for the date/time, which corresponds to Tue 2006-10-17 13:54).

{\*\mvtof move148856603 0100768baa46}
\*\mvtolSignifies the end of a “Move To” bookmark.The bookmark’s tag is used to link this control word 
with the corresponding start of the “Move To” bookmark (\mvtof) in the document and with the 
corresponding “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmfand \mvfml).
The following restrictions are applied to the use of this control word:
If this control word occurs without a corresponding \mvtofcontrol word with a 
matching tag, then it shall be ignored and no “Move To” bookmark exists.
If this control word and its corresponding bookmark start control word occur without a 
matching “Move From” bookmark (\mvfmfand \mvfml), then moved content in this 
move location shall be treated as if it has been inserted instead of moved.

Protection Exceptions

Pictures
An RTF file can include pictures created with other applications. These pictures can be in 
hexadecimal (the default) or binary format. Pictures are destinations and begin with the \pict
controlword. The \pictkeyword is preceded by the\*\shppictdestination control keyword as 
described in the following example. A picture destination has the following syntax:
<pict>'{'\pict(<pictdata> | <shpdata>) '}'
<pictdata>(<brdr>? & <shading>? & <picttype> & <pictsize> & <metafileinfo>?)<data>
<picttype>\emfblip | \pngblip | \jpegblip | \macpict | \pmmetafileN| \wmetafileN|

Control wordMeaning
\emfblipSource of the picture is an EMF (enhanced metafile).
\pngblipSource of the picture is a PNG.
\jpegblipSource of the picture is a JPEG.
\shppictSpecifies a Word 97 through Word 2002 picture. This is a destination control word.
\nonshppictSpecifies that Word 97 through Word 2002 has written a {\pict destination that it will not read on 
input. This keyword is for compatibility with other readers.
\macpictSource of the picture is QuickDraw.
\pmmetafileNSource of the picture is an OS/2 metafile. The Nargument identifies the metafile type. The N
values are described in the \pmmetafileNtablefurther on in this section.
\wmetafileNSource of the picture is a Windows metafile. The Nargument identifies the metafile mapping 
mode(the default type is 1, which is MM_TEXT).
\dibitmapNSource of the picture is a Windows device-independent bitmap. The Nargument identifies the 
bitmap type, which must equal 0.
The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-independent bitmap is the 
concatenation of the BITMAPINFO structure followed by the actual pixel data.
\wbitmapNSource of the picture is a Windows device-dependent bitmap. The Nargument identifies the 
bitmap type (must equal 0).
The information to be included in RTF from a Windows device-dependent bitmap is the result of 
the GetBitmapBits function.


The following is an example of the \shppict group:

{\*\shppict {\pict \emfblip …}}{\nonshppict {\pict …}}
For best device-independence and interoperability with Microsoft products, use of the 
\wbitmapNand \dibitmapNcontrol words is discouraged.Rather, bitmaps should be 
embedded within Windows metafiles and the \wmetafileNcontrol word should be used.For 
more information on the GetDIBits and GetBitmapBits functions,the structure of Windows 
device-independent and device-dependent bitmaps, and information on embedding bitmaps 
within metafiles, seeThe GDI Bitmap Referencesection in MSDN.The following table outlines 
picture control keywords:

Control wordMeaning

Bitmap Information
\wbmbitspixelNNumber of adjacent color bits on each plane needed to define a pixel.Possible values are1 
(monochrome), 4 (16 colors), 8 (256 colors) and 24 (RGB). The default value is 1.
\wbmplanesNNumber of bitmap color planes (must equal 1).
\wbmwidthbytesNSpecifies the number of bytes in each raster line. This value must be an even number because 
the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) assumes that the bit values of a bitmap form an 
array of integer (two-byte) values. In other words, \wbmwidthbytesmultiplied by 8 must be 
the next multiple of 16 greater than or equal to the \picw(bitmap width inpixels) value.

Picture Size, Scaling, and Cropping
\picwNxExtfield if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture width in pixels if the picture is a bitmap 
or from QuickDraw. The Nargument is a long integer.
\pichNyExtfield if the picture is a Windows metafile; picture height in pixels if the picture is a bitmap 
or from QuickDraw. The Nargument is a long integer.
\picwgoalNDesired width of the picture in twips. The Nargument is a long integer.

percent).
\picscaleyNVertical scaling value. The Nargument is a value representing a percentage (default is100
percent).
\picscaledScales the picture to fit within the specified frame. Used only with \macpictpictures.
\picpropIndicates there are shape properties applied to an inline picture. This is a destination control 
word.
\defshpIndicates that the inline picture is a WordArt shape.
\piccroptNTop cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a negative 
value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value 
is 0).
\piccropbNBottom cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a 
negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the 
default value is 0).
\piccroplNLeft cropping value in twips. A positive valuecrops toward the center of the picture; a negative 
value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the default value 
is 0).
\piccroprNRight cropping value in twips. A positive value crops toward the center of the picture; a 
negative value crops away from the center, adding a space border around the picture (the 
default value is 0).
Metafile Information
\picbmpSpecifies whether a metafile contains a bitmap.
\picbppNSpecifies the bits per pixel in a metafile bitmap. The valid range is 1 through 32, with 1, 4, 8, 
and 24 being recognized.
Picture Data
\binNThe picture is in binary format. The numeric parameter Nis the number of bytes that follow. 
Unlike mostother controlwords, \binNtakes a 32-bit parameterand the bytesare any 8-bit 
values.
\blipupiNNrepresents units per inch on a picture (only certain image types need or output this)
\blipuidDestination of the form'{\*'\blipuidXXXX'}'where XXXXis a 16-byte identification number 
for the image.
\bliptagNA unique identifier for a picture, where N is a 32-bit signedinteger value.


The \wbitmapNcontrol word is optional. If no other picture type is specified, the picture is 
assumed to be a Windows bitmap. If \wmetafileNis specified, the Nargument can be one of 
the following Windows mapping modes:

Be careful with spaces following control words when dealing with pictures in binary format. 
When reading files, RTF considers the first space after a control word to be the delimiter and 
subsequent spaces part of the document text. Therefore, any extra spaces are attached to the 
picture, with unpredictable results.
RTF writers should not use the carriage return/line feed (CR/LF) combination to break up 
pictures in binary format. If they do, the CR/LF combination is treated as literal text and 
considered part of the picture data.
The picture in hexadecimal or binary format follows the picture-destination control words. The 
following example illustrates the destination format:

Custom XML Tags
Custom XML Tags and Smart Tags provide a facility for embedding customer-defined semantics 
into the document by using the ability to provide a basic namespace or name for a run or set of 
runs in a document.For example, an invoice document may wish to specify that a particular 
sentence of text is a customer name, in order for that information to be easily extracted from 
the document without the need to parse the text using regular expression matching or similar\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Pictures and Objects

technique. For suchscenarios, multiple facilities are provided for the insertion and roundtripping ofcustomer defined semantics within a document. RTF supports twodistinct forms in 
which customer-defined semantics can be inserted into a document, each with itsown specific 
intended usage:
Smart tags, which provide a basic namespace/name for a run or setof runs within a 
document
Custom XML markup,which providesthe ability to tag the document with XML 
elements and attributes specified by any valid XML Schema file.

The following table lists the keywords that have been added to convert Custom XML Tags data 
to RTF.

On Windows, custom XML parts may besaved to RTF asfollows: The custom xml parts are 
written to an IStorageinterface that is then stamped with the following CLSID: 
CLSID_SAXXMLReader50. The system call OleConvertIStorageToOLESTREAMis then used to 
flatten the IStoragethat is then hex-encoded and writtento the RTF stream. On other 
platforms, the custom data would be "flattened" using equivalent system functions. The format 
of the flattened data is unknown to RTF. Please refer tothe documentation for the custom XML 
parts involved for definitions of the flattened data.
Custom XML parts can be loaded from RTF by decoding them and then using the 
OleConvertOLESTREAMToIStoragesystem call to convert the flattened streamin RTFto an 
IStorage.
The syntax of Custom XML Data Properties is:

<datastore>'{\*' \datastore#SDATA '}'

Objects
Microsoft OLE links, Microsoft OLE embedded objects, and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber 
objects are represented in RTF as objects. Objects are destinations that contain data and a 
result. The data is generally hidden to theapplication that produced the document. A separate 
application uses the data and supplies the appearance of the data. This appearance is the result 
of the object.
The representation of objects in RTF is designed to allow RTF readers that do notunderstand
objects, or do notuse a particular type of object, to use the current result in place of the object. 
This allows the appearance of the object to be maintained through the conversion even though 
the object functionality is lost. Each object comes with optional information about itself, a 
required destination that contains the object data, and an optional result that contains the 
current appearance of the object. This result contains standard RTF. The RTF writer is 
responsible for providing the result so that existing RTF readers that do not support objects, or 
do not support a particular type of object, are able to display the object.
When the object is an OLE embedded or linked object, the data part of the object is the 
structure produced by the OLESaveToStreamfunction. Some OLE clients rely on the OLE 
system to render the object when a copy of the result is not available to the RTF writer for that 
application. In these cases, the object result can be extracted from the structure produced by 
the OLESaveToStream function.For information about the OLESaveToStream function, see 
the Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding Software Development Kit.
This destination has the following syntax:
<obj>('{'\object(<objtype> & <objmod>? & <objclass>? & <objname>? & <objtime>? & 
<objsize>? & <rsltmod>?) <objclsid> ? <objdata> <result> '}') | <pubobject>

\objlockLocks the object from any updates.
\objupdateForces an update to the object before displaying it.Note that this will override any values in the 
<objsize> control words, but values should always be provided for these to maintain backward 
compatibility.
\objclassThe text argument is the object class to use for this object; ignore the class specified in the 
object data. This is a destination control word.
\objnameThe text argument is the name of this object. Thisis a destination control word.
\objtimeLists the time that the object was last updated.

Control wordMeaning

Object Class ID
\oleclsid This sub-destination contains the CLSID for an object for whichno server is registered on the 
computer saving the given RTF file. 
When reading an RTF file, if this destination is present, then readers should know to save the 
CLSID specified by the destination’s argument, and stamp the next object that comes in the RTF 
stream with the specified CLSID.
When writing an RTF file, this destination may be instantiated for objects for which no server is 
registered. This destination’s argument shall be constructed as follows:
1.Take the object’s original CLSID
2.Write the CLSID as the argument for \oleclsid
3.Stamp the object with CLSID_SAXXMLReader50
4.Write the object in the \objdatadestination
Note: If a reader ignores this destination but uses the corresponding \objdatadestination, then 
it will end up with an object that believes it is a SAX XML Reader 5.0 object, even though it may 
be something else.

Object Data
\objdataThis sub-destination contains the data for the object in the appropriate format; OLE objects are in 
OLESaveToStream format. This is a destination control word.
\objaliasThis sub-destination contains the alias record of the publisher object for the Macintosh Edition 
Manager. This is a destination control word.
\objsectThis sub-destination contains the section record of the publisher object for the Macintosh Edition 
Manager. This is a destination control word.

Object Result
\rsltrtfForces the result to be RTF, if possible.
\rsltpictForces the result to be a Windows metafile or MacPict image format, if possible.
\rsltbmpForces the result to be a bitmap, if possible.
\rslttxtForces the result to be plain text, if possible.
\rslthtmlForces theresult to be HTML, if possible.
\rsltmergeUses the formatting of the current result whenever a new result is obtained.
\resultThe result destination is optional in the \objectdestination. The result destination contains the 
last update of the result of the object. The data of the result destination should be standard RTF. 
This allows RTF readers that do not understand objects or the type of object represented to use 
the current result, in place of the object, to maintain appearance. This is a destination control 
word.


When Word or RichEdit isused as an editor for e-mail, the following control word can be 
emitted. Otherwise, it is not seen.

Control wordMeaning
\objattphObject attachment placeholder. Used in the RTF stream when Wordor RichEditis usedas an 
e-mail editor and the message contains attachments. The control word markswhere in the 
text stream the next attachment should appear. It does not define the actual attachment.
Following the control word, a space (\'20) is inserted to act as a placeholder for the 
attachment.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Pictures and Objects

Macintosh Edition Manager Publisher Objects
Word for the Macintosh writes publisher objects for the Macintosh Edition Manager in terms of 
bookmarks (see the Bookmarksection of this specification). The range of publisher objects are 
marked as bookmarks, so these controls are all used within the \bkmkstartdestination. The 
RTF syntax for a publisher object is:

<pubobject>'{\*'\bkmkstart\bkmkpub\pubauto? (<objalias>? & <objsect>) #PCDATA '}'


These control words are described in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\bkmkpubThe bookmark identifies a Macintosh Edition Manager publisher object.
\pubautoThe publisher object updates all Macintosh Edition Manager subscribers of this object 
automatically, whenever it is edited.

The first destination (\shp) is always present. This control word groups everything related to a 
shape together. Following the destination change is basic information regarding the shape. The 
following keywords with values can appear in any order after the “{\shp” control word.



Control wordMeaning

Shape Keywords
\shpleftNSpecifies position of shape from the left of the anchor. The value Nis in twips.
\shptopNSpecifies position of shape from the top of the anchor. The value Nis in twips.
\shpbottomNSpecifies position of shape from the bottom of the anchor. The value Nis in twips.
\shprightNSpecifies position of shape from the right of the anchor. The value N is in twips.
\shplidNA number that is unique to each shape. This keyword is primarily used for linked text boxes. The 
value N is a long integer.
\shpzNDescribes the z-order of the shape. It starts at 0 forthe shape that is furthest from the top, and 
proceeds to the top most shape (N). The shapes that appear inside the header document will 
have a separate z-order, compared to the z-order of the shapes in the main document. For 
instance, both the back-most shape in the header and the back-most main-document shape will 
have a z-order of 0.
\shpfhdrNSet to 0 if the shape is in the main document. Set to 1 if the shape is in the header document.
\shpbxpage The shape is positioned relative to the page in the x(horizontal) direction. 
\shpbxmargin The shape is positioned relative to the margin in the x (horizontal) direction.
\shpbxcolumnThe shape is positioned relative to the column in the x (horizontal) direction.
\shpbxignoreIgnore \shpbxpage, \shpbxmargin,and \shpbxcolumn, in favor ofthe posrelhproperty. The 
ignored properties will be written for backward compatibility with older readers that do not 
understand \posrelh.
\shpbypage The shape is positioned relative to the page in the y (vertical) direction.
\shpbymargin The shape is positioned relative to the margin in the y (vertical) direction.
\shpbyparaThe shape is positioned relative to the paragraph in the y (vertical) direction.
\shpbyignoreIgnore \shpbypage, \shpbymargin,and \shpbxpara, in favor ofthe posrelh property. The 
ignored properties will be written for backward compatibility with older readers that do not 
understand the posrelh property.
\shpwrNDescribes the type of wrap for the shape:
1Wrap around top and bottom of shape (no text allowed beside shape)
2Wrap around shape
3None (wrap as if shape isn’t present)
4Wrap tightly around shape
5Wrap text through shape
\shpwrkNWrap on side (for types 2 and 4 for \shpwrN):
0Wrap both sides of shape
1Wrap left side only
2Wrapright side only
3Wrap only on largest side\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Shapes

Control wordMeaning
\shpfblwtxtNDescribes relative z-ordering:
0Text is below shape
1Shape is below text
\shplockanchorLock anchor for a shape.
\shptxtText for a shape. The text must follow all of the other properties for the shape (inside the 
\shpinstdestination) and must appear in the following format:
{\shptxtAny valid RTF for the current text box }
NoteFor linked text boxes, the first text box of the linked set has the entire story, so all 
following text boxes will not have a \shptxtfield.
\shpinstShape instruction destination containing the shape description
\shprsltThis is where the Word 6.0 and Word 95 drawn object RTF can be placed. 
\shpgrpSpecifies a group shape. The parameters following this keyword are the same as those following 
\shp. The order of the shapes inside a group is from bottom to top in z-order. 
Inside a \shpgrp, no {\shprslt …} fields would be generated (that is, only the root-level shape 
can have a\shprsltfield (this field describes the entire group). For example:
{\shpgrp…{\shp …(and all sub-items as usual) }
{\shp … (and all sub-items as usual) }
Note{\shpgrp …} can be substituted for {\shp …} to create groups inside groups.
\snDestination for a drawing property name (see table in Drawing Object Properties)
\spDestination for a drawing property and takes a '{' \sn…'}{' \sv…'}'group pair.
\svDestination for a drawing property value
\svbDestination containing binary ink information.Used within the value of the pInkDataproperty:
Example:
{\sp{\sn pInkData}{\sv 
{\*\svb00ad021d04ba06dc02012000680c0000000000c00000000000004658cf548ae697c54f8f06

73d33406d3a33400 }}
\hsvDestination for theme color information.


With the exception of \shplidN,the control words listed in the preceding table do not apply for 
shapes that are within a group. For more information about groups, see the Introductionsection 
of this specification.
Drawing Object Properties
The bulk of a drawing object is defined as a series of properties. The {\shp …control word is 
followed by {\*\shpinst, followed, in turn, by a list of all the properties of a shape. Each of the 
properties is in the following format:

{\sp{\sn PropertyName}{\sv PropertyValueInformation}{\*\hsv AccentandTintandShadeInformation}}
The control word for the drawing object property is \sp. Each property has a pairing of the 
name (\sn) and value (\sv) control words placed in the shape property group. For example, 
the vertical flip property is represented as:

{\sp{\sn fFlipV}{\sv 1}}
Here, the name of the property is fFlipVand the value is 1, which indicates True. All shape 
properties follow this basic format. Only properties that have been explicitly set for a shape are \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Shapes

written out in RTF. Other properties assume the default values (a property may be set to the 
default value explicitly). 
The \*\hsvdestination holds the theme information for a shape color (color, tint, and shade). 
If the value is not a color or the shape color is not a themed color, this control word will not be 
written.This control word is always preceded by a non-theme equivalent color, so that themeunaware applications can read what the given color evaluates to while safely ignoring the theme 
control words new to Word 2007.
For example, consider the partial RTF for a rectangle filled with the pink color. In this example, 
pink is alsoa theme color so \hsvis also written with the theme color information, consisting of 
which theme color (\caccentone), and the tint (\ctintN), and shade (\cshadeN).

{\shp{\*\shpinst{\sp{\sn shapeType}{\sv 1}}{\sp{\sn fillColor}{\sv 9189631}{\*\hsv

c3DOriginXThe following c3DOriginYand c3DSkewAnglevalues 
define the origin relative to the viewpoint origin 
measured.
These values are 16.16 numbers that specify the 
position of the origin within the shape bounding box, as 
multiples of the width and height of that bounding box 
and relative to the center (that is, they are displaced 
from the center). When these values are applied the 
actual transformed shape path is used, rather than the 
shape geometry (compare with the shadow and 
perspective values that work on the geometry bounding 
box, not the actual points). This means that a shape 
that extends outside the geometry bounding box (such 
as a text effect) is handled “correctly”for the calculation 
of the 3-D origin.

BooleanFALSE


pctHRPercentage width for a horizontal line in (in 10ths of a

Word’s RTF reader recognizes \hruleto mean insert a horizontal rule with default properties at 
the end of the document. It is ignored elsewhere in the document and Word writes a horizontal 
line shape instead of \hrule.
The format of the value depends on the property name it is paired with. Many values are simple 
single numbers. Distances are expressed in EMU units(English-metric units). Fractional or fixed 
values are expressed using units that are 1/65536thof a whole. Angles are expressed as 
fractions of a degree. Colors are 24-bit color values. Booleans have two possible values: 1 for 
Trueand 0 for False. 
Arrays are formatted as a sequence of numbers separated by semicolons. The first number tells 
the size of each element in the array in bytes. The number of bytes per element may be 2, 4, or 
8. When the size of the element is 8, each element is represented as a group of two numbers. 
The second number tells the number of elements in the array. For example, the points of a 
square polygon are written as:

{sv8;4;{0,0};{100,0};{100,100};{0,100}}
The ShapeTypeproperty can have the following possible values.

The following keywords are related to defining a hyperlink hanging offa shape,that is, all of 
them are insidea {\sp{\sn …}{\sv…}}. These specifically can occur in the \spto define a 
property that is a hyperlink. They are used in the following way:

{\hl {\hlloc RTF-string }{\hlsrc RTF-string}{\hlfr RTF-string}}
The three groups can be in any order and provide the three strings needed to fully describe a 
hyperlink. The control words are described in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\hlDestination for hyperlink attached to a shape.
\hllocLocation string for hyperlink.
\hlsrcSource string for hyperlink.
\hlfrDisplay name for hyperlink.





Footnotes
The \footnotecontrol word introduces a footnote. Footnotes are destinations in RTF. A footnote 
is anchored to the character that immediately precedes the footnote destination (that is, the 
footnote moves with the character to which it is anchored). If automatic footnote numbering is 
defined, the destination can be preceded by a footnote reference character, identified by the 
control word \chftn. Microsoft products do not support footnotes within headers, footers, or 
comments (annotations). Placing a footnote within headers, footers, or comments will often 
result in a corrupted document.
Footnotes have the following syntax:

<footnote>'{'\footnote\ftnalt? <para>+ '}'
Here is an example of a destination containing footnotes:

\ftnbj\ftnrestart \sectd \linemod0\linex0\endnhere \pard\plain

\ri1170 \fs20 {\pu6 Mead's landmark study has been amply annotated.\chftn

the basis for the paper. As others have noted, \chftn\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Footnotes, Fields, etc.

\par
To indicate endnotes, the following combination is emitted: \footnote\ftnalt. Existing readers 
will ignore the \ftnalt control word and treat everything as a footnote. 
For other control words relating to footnotes, see the sections titled Document Formatting 
Properties, Section Formatting Properties,and Special Charactersin this specification.
Comments (Annotations)
RTF comments (annotations) have two parts; the author ID (introduced by the control word 
\atnid) and the commenttext (introduced by the control word \annotation); there is no group 
enclosing both parts. Microsoft products do not support comments within headers, footers, or 
footnotes. Placing a commentwithin headers, footers, or footnotes mayresult in a corrupted 
document. Each part of the commentis an RTF destination. Comments are anchored to the 
character that immediately precedes the comment.
If an annotation is associated with an annotation bookmark, the following two destination 
control words precede and follow the bookmark. The alphanumeric string N, such as a long 
integer, represents the bookmark name.
<atrfstart>'{\*'\atrfstartN'}'
<atrfend>'{\*'\atrfendN'}'


Comments have the following syntax:

<annot><annotid> <atnauthor> <atntime>? \chatn<atnicn>? <annotdef> 
<annotid>'{\*'\atnid#PCDATA '}'
<atnauthor>'{\*'\atnauthor#PCDATA '}'
<annotdef>'{\*'\annotation<atndate>? <atnref> <atnparent> <para>+ '}'
<atnref>'{\*'\atnrefN'}'

<atndate>'{\*'\atndate <date> '}'

Fields
The \fieldcontrol word introduces a field destination, which contains the text of fields. Fields 
have the following syntax:

<formula>See Office OpenXML, Section 2.15.3.


For detailed discussion of the <para>+ content in <fieldinst>, please see Office OpenXML, 
Section 2.15. There are several control words that alter the interpretation of the field. These 
control words are listed in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\fieldDestination for a field.
\flddirtyA formatting change has been made to the field result since the field was last updated.
\fldeditText has been added to, or removed from, the field result since the field was last updated.
\fldlockField is locked and cannot be updated.
\fldprivResult is not in a form suitable for display (for example, binary data used by fields whose result is 
a picture).


Two sub destinations are required within the \fielddestination. They must be enclosed in 
braces ({}) and begin with the following control words.

Control wordMeaning
\*\fldinstField instructions. This is a destination control word.
\fldrsltMost recent calculated result of the field. This is a destination control word.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Footnotes, Fields, etc.

If the instruction for a field contains a file name, then the \cpgNcontrol can be used to define 
the character set of the file name. See Code Page Supportin this specification for details.
The \fldrslt control word should be included even if a result was not calculated because most 
readers (even those readers that do not recognize fields) can generally include the value of the
\fldrslt destination in the document. A field result should not start with a table, because it may 
break some RTF readers.
The following is an example of some field text:

{\field {\*\fldinst AUTHOR \\*MERGEFORMAT}{\fldrslt Joe Smith}}\par\pard

{\field{\*\fldinst time \\@ "h:mm AM/PM"}{\fldrslt 8:12 AM}}


You can use the \fldaltcontrol word to specify that the given field reference is to an endnote. 
For example, the following field in RTF is a reference to a footnote

{\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber }{\fldrslt 1}}
The following is an example of a reference to an endnote

{\field{\*\fldinst NOTEREF _RefNumber \fldalt}{\fldrslt I}}
If the specified field is a form field, the \*\datafielddestination appears as a part of 
<fieldinst> and contains the binary data ofa form field instruction. For example:

{\field{\*\fldinst {\*\bkmkstart Text1} FORMTEXT {{\*\datafield 

00000000000000000554657874310008476565207768697a0000000000000000000000}}}{\fldrslt Default 
Result}}{\*\bkmkend Text1}

Note the \datafielddestination requires the \* prefix. The \fldtype, \date, \time,and \wpeqnfield keywords 
should be ignored.


An example of the AUTONUM field for ①.is

{\field{\*\fldinst AUTONUM \\* CircleNum}{\fldrslt \f31505 \u9312\’3f\f31506 .}}
An exampleof a HYPERLINK field is

{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "http://www.microsoft.com"}{\fldrslt Microsoft}}
This displays as Microsoftwithout any coloring since none is specified in the “friendly name” 
result portion of the field (in the {\fldrslt …}). But you can click on it to go to Microsoft’s web 
site.More detailed discussion of the HYPERLINK field is given in Office OpenXML, Section 
2.15.5.26.
EQ field and East Asian Formatting
The EQ field is explained in Office OpenXML, 2.15.5.20. For the most part, this field is seldom 
used, since the Equation Editor and Word 2007 math editing and display facilities are far 
superior. But it’s still usedforthreeEast Asianformatting constructs:phonetic guide, enclose, 
and combine.The two other East Asian formatting constructs that Word supports, \twoinoneN
(sometimes called Warichu) and \horzvertN(sometimes called tatenakayoko) have their own 
RTF and underlying implementations.
This subsection discusses how the phonetic-guide, enclose and combine constructs are created 
using the Word EQ field using the EQ function \o(<this>,<that>), which displays <this> over \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Footnotes, Fields, etc.

<that>. The major difference between the three constructs is the displacement of the <this> 
relative to the <that>.
Consider first the phonetic guide, which is often call ruby. This displays a ruby-text annotation 
(<ruby>) in a smaller type size above, below, or to the side of a base text (<base>). The ruby 
text is used to clarify the base text in some way, typically how the base text is pronounced. 
When Japanese text is displayed from left to right (instead of vertically), the ruby text is 
displayed above or below the base text. The ruby text can have variousjustifications.

For example, the ruby construct 
にほんご,日本語displaysthe Japanese forthe term"Japanese 

language",日本語, together with the Hiragana ruby textにほんご, which is how to pronounce 
"Japanese language" in Japanese.
To display thisconstructwith the EQ field, add the field switches and EQ functions 
\* jcN\* "Font:MS Mincho" \* hpsN\o\ad(\s\upN(<ruby>),<base>)
Here the Nof the jcNswitch specifies the kind of ruby justification as defined in the table


NMeaning

0Center <ruby> with respect to <base>
1Distribute difference in space between longer and shorter text in the 
latter, evenly between each character
2Distribute difference in space between longer and shorter text in the 
latter using a ratio of 1:2:1 which corresponds to lead : intercharacter : end
3Align <ruby> with the left of <base>

4Align <ruby> with the right of <base>
5Display <ruby> vertically to the right of <base>, regardless of the 
<base> alignment

The \* "Font:..." specifies the font and the \* hpsNspecifies the number of half points to use for 
the ruby text size. The \ad switch for the \o function says to use the distributed justification 
defined by the jcNentry. The \s\upN(...) is the EQ shift function that shifts its argument up if 
the \upNswitch is used and down if the \doNswitch is used. To display <ruby> above <base>, 
use \upNand to display <ruby> below <base>, use \doN. HereNis the number of points to 
shift. Note that (half) points don’t scale with the text size, so the parameters have to be 
recalculated if a change in text size is desired.
For the combine formatting construct, the characters to be combined are split into two groups, 
<above> and <below>. The corresponding Word EQ field containssomething like
\o(\s\up5(<above>),\s\do2(<below>))
where the font size is chosen to be 6 pts (\fs12). This construct displays <above> over <below>, 
sort of the way ruby displays <ruby> over <base>, but for the combine construct <above> isn’t 
shifted up so far and <below> is shifted down a bit. As for the ruby construct, since the shifts 
are in points, the combine structure doesn’t scale with text size correctly.For example, 
combining abcd, we get ab,cd, which has the EQ field "eq \o(\s\up 5(ab),\s\do 2(cd))".
For the enclose construct that looks like Ⓠ, the EQ field can contain
\o\ac(\uc0\u9675,Q)\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Footnotes, Fields, etc.

where 967510= 25CB16, i.e., a white circle. Here \ac switch means center align one argument 
over the other (note that there’s no \s() objectand hence no vertical shift) and we include \uc0 
to get rid of the multibyte translation that would otherwise follow \u9675.
When encoding these EQ fields in RTF, one has to duplicate every backslash, so that the 
backslash is taken literally instead of the start of a control word. For example, the "enclose" EQ 
field above could be represented by the RTF
{\field{\*\fldinst EQ \\o\\ac(\\fs24\\uc0\\u9675,\\fs16 Q)}{\fldrslt}}
This structure also doesn’t scale with font size, since the white circle and the Q musthave 
appropriate relative font sizes. 
Note:Word’sRTF forEQ fields always hasa null field result (empty \fldrslt), so if a reader of the RTF doesn’t 
understand the EQ \fldinst, it displays nothing for the field.
Form Fields
Form fields occur inside thefield \fldinstgroup and describe the propertiesof form controls. 
They have the syntax
<formfield>'{\*' \formfield'{' <formparams> <formstrings> '}}'

Index Entries
The \xecontrol word introduces an index entry. Index entries in RTF are destinations. An index 
entry has the following syntax:

<idx>'{'\xe(\xefN? & \bxe? & \ixe?) <entry> (<txe> | <rxe>)? '}'
<entry>(<char>+ <yxe>?) | ('{'<char>+ <yxe>? '}')
<yxe>\yxe<char>+ #PCDATA
<txe>'{'\txe<char>+ #PCDATA'}'
<rxe>'{'\rxe#PCDATA'}'
<pxe>'\*' \pxe<char>+ #PCDATA


If the text of the index entry is not formatted as hidden text with the \vcontrol word, then the 
text is put into the document as well as into the index. Similarly, the text of the \txesub 
destination, described later in this section, becomes part of the document if it is not formatted 
as hidden text. For more information on the \vcontrol word, see Font/Character Formatting 
Propertiesin this specification. 
The following control words may also be used.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1Footnotes, Fields, etc.

Control wordMeaning
\xefNAllows multiple indexes within the same document. Nis an integer that corresponds to the 
ASCII value of a letter between A and Z.
\bxeFormats page number or cross-reference in bold.
\ixeFormats page number or cross-reference in italic.

\rxe Text argument is a bookmark for the range of page numbers. This is a destination control 
word.
\yxePronunciation (or heading) for index entry, used in phonetic sorting.
\*\pxe“Yomi”(pronunciation) for index entry.

Table of Contents Entries
The \tccontrol word introduces a table of contents entry, which can be used to build the actual 
table of contents. The \tcncontrol word marks a table of contents entry that will not have a 
page number associated with it; this is used in place of \tcfor such entries. Table of contents 
entries are destinations, and they have the following syntax:

<toc>'{'\tc |\tcn(\tcfN? & \tclN?) <char>+ '}'
As with index entries, text that is not formatted as hidden with the \vcharacter-formatting 
control word is put into the document. The following control words can also be used in this 
destination.

Control wordMeaning
\tcfNType of table being compiled. Nis mapped by existing Microsoft software to a letter between A 
and Z (default is67, which maps to C, used for tables of contents).

Bidirectional Language Support
RTF supports bidirectional writingorders for languages such as Arabic. The controls are 
described in the following table (as well as in the appropriate sections throughout this 
specification). Also refer to the associated character properties defined in Associated Character 
Propertiesin this specification.
All the control words relating to bidirectional language support are repeated here for

East AsianSupport
Word 2000 and subsequent releases provide full support for all East Asian features introduced in 
all previous Asian versions of Word and they have the ability to read and write RTF keywords 
related to such features. This section provides details on the handling of East Asian characters. 
For more information on handling East Asian features, see the appropriate subsection in the 
Contents of an RTF Filesectionin this document.See also EQ field and East Asian Formatting.
Escaped Expressions
An escaped expression (for example, \'hh, \\, or \{)is usable in all RTF control words.
In general RTF should be written out with all characters above 0x7Fin the escaped form, \'hh
or the \uNform if an ANSIversion doesn’t exist.The following table shows values for character 
codes.

Character codeWrite out as
0x00 <= ch < 0x20Escaped (\'hh)
0x20 <= ch < 0x80Raw (non-escaped) character
0x80 <= ch <= 0xFFEscaped (\'hh)
0x5C, 0x7B, 0x7D (special 
RTF characters \,{,})
Escaped (\'hh)


When anRTF reader encounters raw characters in the leading-byte range of the double-byte 
character, it regards the next character as the trailing byte of the double-byte character and 
combines the two characters into one double-byte character. The following table shows possible 
byte combinations.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1East Asian RTF

Leading byteTrailing byteValidity
EscapedRaw (0x20 <= ch <= 0x7f) Valid (standard format for double-byte character)
EscapedEscaped (other)Valid (standard format for double-byte character)
RawRawValid (RTF-J format for double-byte character)
RawEscapedInvalid



Note: Characters that are special RTF symbols (\,{, or }) should always be escaped, preferably using the \'hh 
syntax, since some readers may have trouble with \\, \{, or \}.
Character Setand Mapping
Wordspecifies the character set in the font table using \fcharsetN. Word interprets \cpg437
as \fcharset0and \cpg932as \fcharset128if it encounters these control words when 
reading RTF.
Word maps single-byte characters according to character set information (for example, 
Macintosh to ANSI) and leaves double-byte characters unmapped.
Font Family

RTFcontrol wordsDefinition and interpretation in Word
\jisRTFuses \jisas a control word for character set. Wordinterprets this as 
\ansi, which is the default character set used if the character set is not 
defined.

\fjminchou and \fjgothicRTFuses \fjminchouand \fjgothicto specify font family. Word interprets 
these as \fnil, which is the default font family.

ShiftJIS Font Without \cpgNor \fcharsetN
If \cpgNor \fcharsetNcontrol words are not present, Word uses the text metrics of the font 
to determinethe character set of these fonts.
Composite Fonts (Associated Fonts for International Runs)
Worddefines control words to specify composite fonts as associated character properties. These 
control words follow the rule of associated character properties and understand font designation 
(\afN).All other <aprops> are ignored in Word. In an East Asian context (see Associated 
Character Propertiesfor the general case) composite fonts have the following syntax:

<atext><losbrun> | <hisbrun> | <dbrun>
<losbrun>\hich\afN& <aprops> \dbch\afN& <aprops> \loch<ptext>
<hisbrun>\loch\afN& <aprops> \dbch\afN& <aprops> \hich<ptext>
<dbrun>\loch\afN& <aprops> \hich \afN& <aprops> \dbch<ptext>
These control words are described in the following table.

Control wordMeaning
\lochSpecifies a run of the characters in the low-ANSI (0x00–0x7F) area.
\hichFor the characters in the high-ANSI (0x80–-0xFF) area.
\dbchSpecifies a run of the double-byte characters.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1East Asian RTF

Wordwrites out associated character properties in the styles. In the style sheet, the <dbrun> 
definition should be used for compatibility with applications that have transparent readers.

{\stylesheet{\loch\af5\hich\af5\dbch\f27\fs20\snext0 Normal;}}
If the composite font definitionmatches the style, only the control word (\loch, \hich, or 
\dbch) is used to distinguish the type of run, along with the font information for transparent 
readers.

{\fonttbl{\f5\fswiss\fcharset0\fprq2 Arial;}{\f27\froman\fcharset128\fprq1 Mincho;}}

{\stylesheet{\loch\af5\hich\af5\dbch\f27\fs20\snext0 Normal;}}

\pard\plain

{\dbch\f27\fs20 \’82\’b1\’82\’ea\’82\’cd}

{\loch\f5Test }

{\dbch\f27\’82\’c5\’82\’b7\’81B}

\par}
If one or all of \loch, \hich, and \dbchare missing from the style sheet definition (or the 
character set does not match), Word applies the following fonts to each character run in the 
style using the bulleted rules in the next paragraph.

Control wordFont Word J applies
\lochSame font as \fN.
\hichAny font whose character set is ANSI_CHARSET.
\dbchAny font whose character set is SHIFTJIS_CHARSET.


If the composite font control words are missing from the character run, Wordwill interpret all 
characters below 0x80 as a \lochrun. Characters above or equal to 0x80 are determined using 
thefollowing rules:
If the character is in the leading-byte range and the next character is in the trailing-byte 
range of a double-byte character, it is treated as a \dbchrun (one double-byte character). For 
example,

\’99\’47→
If the character is in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character but the next 
character is not in the trailing-byte range, it is treated as a \hichrun (two high-ANSI or lowANSI characters). For example,
\’99\’FF→ÿ
If the character is in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character and is the last 
character in the run, it is treated as a \hichrun (one high-ANSI character). For example,
\’99\par→
If the character is not in the leading-byte range of a double-byte character, it is treated 
as a \hichrun (one high-ANSI character). For example,
\’FF→ÿ\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1East Asian RTF

Appendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application
This appendix gives the source code for a sample RTF reader program.

NoteThe sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, and Microsoft does not provide technical or any other type of 
support for the sample RTF reader code or the RTF specification.
How to Write an RTF Reader
There are three basic things that an RTF reader must do:
Separate text from RTF controls.
Parse an RTF control.
Dispatch an RTF control.
Separating text from RTF controls is relatively simple, because all RTF controls begin with a 
backslash. Therefore, any incoming character that is not a backslash is text and will be handled 
as text.
Parsing an RTF control is also relatively simple. An RTF control is either (a) a sequence of 
alphabetical characters followed by an optional numeric parameter, or (b) a single nonalphanumeric character.
Dispatching an RTF control, on the other hand, is relatively complicated. A recursive-descent 
parser tends to be overly strict because RTF is intentionally vague about the order of various 
properties relative to one another. However, whatever method you use to dispatch an RTF 
control, your RTF reader should do the following:
Ignore control words you do not understand or do not want to implement. 
Many RTF readers fail when they come across an unknown RTF control. Because Microsoft is \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1RTF Reader

continually adding new RTF controls, this limits an RTF reader to working with the RTF from one 
particular product (usually some version of Word for Windows).
Always understand \*
One of the most important things an RTF reader can do is to understand the \* control. This 
control introduces a destination that is not part of the document. It tells the RTF reader that if 
the reader does not understand the next control word, then it should skip the entire enclosing 
group.
Remember that binary data can occur when you’re skipping RTF.
A simple way to skip a group in RTF is to keep a running count of the opening 
braces the RTF reader has encountered in the RTF stream. When the RTF reader 
sees an opening brace, it increments the count. When the reader sees a closing 
brace, it decrements the count.When the count becomes negative, the end of the 
group was found. Unfortunately, this does notwork when the RTF file contains a 
\binNcontrol; the reader must explicitly checkeach control word found to see if it 
is a \binNcontrol, and if found, skip that many bytes before resuming its scanning 
for braces.
A Sample RTF Reader Implementation
This implementation uses a table-driven approach to reading RTF. Theapproach allows the most 
flexibility in reading RTF but makes it difficult to detect incorrect RTF. This reader works exactly 
as described in the RTF specification and uses the principles of operation described within the 
RTF specification. This reader is designed to be simple to understand but is not intended to be 
efficientor all inclusive. This RTF reader also implements the three design principles listed in the 
previous section.
The RTF reader consists of the following four files:
rtfdecl.h, prototypes for all functionsin the RTF reader
rtftype.h, types used in the RTF reader
rtfreadr.c, main program, the main loop of the RTF reader, and the RTF control 
parser
rtfactn.c, dispatch routines for the RTF reader
rtfdecl.h 
rtfdecl.h is straightforward and requires little explanation.
rtfreadr.c
Like rtfdecl.h, rtfreadr.c is also reasonably straightforward. The function ecRtfParseseparates 
text from RTF controls and handles text, and the function ecParseRtfKeywordparses an RTF 
control and also collects any parameter that follows the RTF control.
rtftype.h
rtftype.h begins by declaring a sample set of character, paragraph, section, and document 
properties. These structures are present to demonstrate how the dispatch routines can modify 
any particular property and are not actually used to format text.
For example, the following enumeration describes the destination to which the text should be 
routed to:

typedef enum { rdsNorm, rdsSkip } RDS;\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1RTF Reader

Because this is just a sample RTF reader, there are only two destinations. A more complicated 
reader would add an entry to this enumeration for each destination supported [for example, 
headers, footnotes, endnotes, comments (annotations), bookmarks, and pictures].
The following enumeration describes the internal state of the RTF parser:

typedef enum { risNorm, risBin, risHex } RIS;
This is entirely separate from the state of the dispatch routines and the destination state; other 
RTF readers may not necessarily have anything similar to this.
The following structure encapsulates the state that must be saved at a group start and restored 
at a group end:

typedef struct save

{

struct save *pNext;

CHP chp;

PAP pap;

SEP sep;

DOP dop;

RDS rds;

RIS ris;

} SAVE;
The following enumeration describes a set of classes for RTF controls:

typedef enum {kwdChar,kwdDest, kwdProp, kwdSpec} KWD;
Use kwdCharfor controls that represent special characters (such as \-, \{, or 
\}).
Use kwdDestfor controls that introduce RTF destinations.
Use kwdPropfor controls that modify some sort of property.
Use kwdSpecfor controls that need to run some specialized code.
The following enumeration defines the number of PROP structures (described later) that will be 
used. There will typically be an ipropfor every field in the character, paragraph, section, and 
document properties.

typedef enum {ipropBold, ipropItalic, ipropUnderline, ipropLeftInd,

ipropRightInd, ipropFirstInd, ipropCols, ipropPgnX, ipropPgnY,

ipropXaPage, ipropYaPage, ipropXaLeft, ipropXaRight,

ipropYaTop, ipropYaBottom, ipropPgnStart, ipropSbk, 

ipropPgnFormat, ipropFacingp, ipropLandscape, ipropJust,

ipropPard, ipropPlain,

ipropMax} IPROP;


The following structure is a very compact way to describe how to locate the address of a 
particular value in one of the property structures:\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1RTF Reader

typedef enum {actnSpec, actnByte, actnWord} ACTN;

typedef enum {propChp, propPap, propSep, propDop} PROPTYPE;

typedef struct propmod

{

ACTN actn;

PROPTYPE prop;

int offset;

} PROP;


The actnfield describes the width of the value being described: if the value is a byte, then actn
is actnByte; if the value is a word, then actnis actnWord; if the value is neither a byte nor a 
word, then you can use actnSpecto indicate that some C code needs to be run to set the value. 
The propfield indicates theproperty structure that is being described; propChpindicates that 
the value is located within the CHP structure; propPapindicates that the value is located within 
the PAP structure. Finally, the offset field contains the offset of the value from the start of the 
structure. The offsetof() macro is usually used to initialize this field.
The following structure describes how to parse a particular RTF control:

typedef enum {ipfnBin, ipfnHex, ipfnSkipDest } IPFN;

typedef enum {idestPict, idestSkip } IDEST;

typedef struct symbol

{

char *szKeyword;

int dflt;

bool fPassDflt;

KWD kwd;

int idx;

} SYM;
szKeywordpoints to the RTF control being described; kwddescribes the class of the particular 
RTF control (described earlier); dfltis the default value for this control, and fPassDfltshould be 
nonzero if the value in dfltshould be passed to the dispatch routine. 
Note: fPassDfltis only nonzero for control words that normally set a particular value.For 
example, the various section break controls typically have nonzero fPassDfltcontrols, but 
controls that take parameters should not.
Idxis a generalized index; its use depends on the kwdbeing used for this control.
If kwdis kwdChar,then idxis the character that should be output.
If kwdis kwdDest,then idxis the idestfor the new destination.
If kwdis kwdProp,then idxis the ipropfor the appropriate property.
If kwdis kwdSpec,then idxis an ipfnfor the appropriate function.
With this structure it is very simple to dispatch an RTF control word. Once the reader isolates 
the RTF control word and its (possibly associated) value, the reader then searches an array of \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1RTF Reader

SYM structures to find the RTF control word. If the control word is not found, the RTF reader 
ignores it, unless the previous control was \*, in which case the reader must scan past an entire 
group.
If the control word is found, the reader then uses the kwdvalue from the SYM structure to 
determine what to do. This is, in fact, exactly what the function ecTranslateKeywordin the file 
RTFACTN.C does. 
rtfactn.c
Rtfactn.c contains the tables describing the properties and control words, and the routines to 
evaluate properties (ecApplyPropChange) and to dispatch control words 
(ecTranslateKeyword).
The tables are the keys to understanding the RTF dispatch routines. The following are some 
sample entriesfrom both tables, along with a brief explanation of each entry.
Property Table 
This table must have an entry for every iprop.

actnByte,   propChp,    offsetof(CHP, fBold),       // ipropBold
This property says that the ipropBoldproperty is a byte parameter bound to chp.fBold.

actnWord,   propPap,    offsetof(PAP, xaRight),     // ipropRightInd
This property says that ipropRightIndis a word parameter bound to pap.xaRight.

actnWord,   propSep,    offsetof(SEP, cCols),       // ipropCols
This property says that ipropColsis a word parameter bound to sep.cCols.

actnSpec,   propChp,    0,                          // ipropPlain
This property says that ipropPlainis a special parameter. Instead of directly evaluating it, 
ecApplyPropChangewill run some custom C code to apply a property change.
Control Word Table

"b",        1,      fFalse,     kwdProp,    ipropBold,
This structure says that the control \bsets the ipropBold property. Because fPassDfltis False, 
the RTF reader only uses the default value if the control does not have a parameter. If no 
parameter is provided, the RTF reader uses a value of 1.

"sbknone",  sbkNon, fTrue,      kwdProp,    ipropSbk,
This entry says that the control \sbknonesets the ipropSbkproperty. Because fPassDfltis 
True, the RTFreader always uses the default value of \sbknone, even if the control has a 
parameter.

"par",      0,      fFalse,     kwdChar,    0x0a,
This entry says that the control \paris equivalent to a 0x0a (line feed) character.

"tab",      0,      fFalse,     kwdChar,    0x09,
This entry says that the control \tabis equivalent to a 0x09 (tab) character.

"bin",      0,      fFalse,     kwdSpec,    ipfnBin,
This entry says that the control \binshould run some C code. The particular piece of C code can 
be locatedby the ipfnBinparameter.\fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1RTF Reader

"fonttbl",  0,      fFalse,     kwdDest,    idestSkip,
This entry says that the control \fonttblshould change to the destination idestSkip.
Notes on Implementing Other RTF Features
The table-driven approach to dispatching RTF controls used by the sample converter does not 
implement any syntax checking. For most controls this is not a problem; a controlmodifies the 
appropriate property. However, some controls, such as those for tabs and borders, are 
dependent on other control words either before or after the current control word.
There are some standard techniques for handling these features.
Tabs and Other Control Sequences Terminating in a Fixed Control
The best way to implement these types of control sequences is to have a global structure that 
represents the current state of the tab descriptor (or other entity). As the modifiers come in, 
they modify the various fields of the global structure. When the fixed control at the end of the 
sequence is dispatched, it adds the entire descriptor and reinitializes the global variable.
Borders and Other Control Sequences Beginning with a Fixed Control
The best way to implement these types of control sequences is to have a global pointer that is 
initialized when the fixed control is dispatched. The controls that modify the fixed control then 
modify fields pointed to by the global pointer.
Other Problem Areas in RTF

Style Sheets
Style sheets can be handled as destinations. However, styles have default values, just as every 
other control does. RTF readers should be sure to handle a missing style control as the default 
style value (that is, 0).
Property Changes
Some RTF readers use various bits of RTF syntax to mark property changes. In particular, they 
assume that property changes will occur only after a group start, which is not correct. Because 
there is a variety of ways to represent identical property changes in RTF, RTF readers should 
review the changes in the properties and not at any particular way of representing a property 
change. In particular, properties can be changed explicitly with a control word or implicitly at the 
end of a group. For example, these three sequences of RTF have exactly the same semantics, 
and should be translated identically:

{\b bold \i Bold Italic \i0 Bold again}

{\b bold {\i Bold Italic }Bold again}

{\b bold \i Bold Italic \plain\b Bold again}

Fields
All versions of Microsoft Word for Windows and version 6.0 and later of Microsoft Word for the 
Macintosh have fields. If you are writing an RTF reader and expect to doanything with fields, 
keep the following notes in mind:
Field instructions may have arbitrary amounts of character formatting and 
arbitrarily nested groups. While the groups will be properly nested within the field 
instructions, you may already be inside an arbitrary number of groups by the time \fRich Text Format (RTF) Specification, Version 1.9.1RTF Reader

you know the field you are working with. If you then expect to be able to skip to the 
end of the field instructions, you’ll have to know how many groups have started so 
that you can skip to the end properly.
Some fields, the INCLUDE field in particular, can have section breaks in the field 
results. If this occurs, then the text after the end of the field does not have the 
same section properties as the text at the start of the field. Therefore, the section 
properties must not be restored when the field results contain section breaks.
Tables
Tables are probably the hardest part of RTF to read and write correctly. Because of the way 
Microsoft word processors implement tables, and the table-driven approach of many Microsoft 
RTF readers, it is very easy to write tables in RTF that are not compatible with Microsoft word 
processors when you try to read the RTF. Here are some guidelines to reduce problems with 
tables in RTF:
Place the entire table definition before any paragraph properties, including \pard.
Verify that the number of cells in the RTF matches the number of cell definitions.
Some controls must be the same in all paragraphs in a row. In particular, all 
paragraphs in a row must have the same positioning controls, and all paragraphs in 
a row must have \intblspecified.
Do not use the \sbyscontrol inside a table. \sbysis a holdover from Word for MSDOS and early versions of Word for the Macintosh. Word for Windows and current 
versions of Word for the Macintosh translate \sbysas a table. 
Cell definitions starting before the left margin of the paper begins (that is, the 
parameter plus the left margin is negative) are always in error.

Appendix B: Index of RTF Control Words
The control word table contains a list of each RTF control word, the name of the section where it 
may be found, and its type. The types are described in the following table.


TypeMeaning
FlagThis control word ignores any parameter.
DestinationThis control word starts a group or destination. It ignores any parameter.
SymbolThis control word represents a special character.
ToggleThis control word distinguishes between the ON and OFF states for the given 
property. The control word with no parameter or a nonzero parameter is used 
to turn on the property, while the control word with a zero parameter is used 
to turn it off.
ValueThis control word requires a parameter.

Note: In the following table, the names of all control words added in version 95or later are flagged with the version 
number in which they were added (95, 97, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007).Control words defined in the 1987 RTF 
Specificationare flagged with 87.More control words were in Word 3.0 for the Apple Macintosh in 1987, but the 
basic destinations are defined in the specification.For the Word 2007 CompatibilityPack, many control words that 
were added by Word 2007 had to be ported backto Word2003and Word2002via patches. So there arequite a 
few control words flagged with 2007 that can now be recognized bythe older Word versions.

Control wordMeaning
\disabledCharacter formatting property used by RichEdit to mark text runs as disabled. \disabledturns 
on the disabled effect and \disabled0turns it off.
\protectCharacter formatting flag used by RichEdit to mark text runs as protected. Introduced for Outlook 
97. \protectturns on protection and \protect0turns it off.
\pwdNSubstitute for \rtfN. Introduced by Pocket Word to distinguish its files from general RTF files. 
Currently only 1 is emitted and the number is ignored by the RTF reader.
\urtfNIdentifies an RTF file in which all text characters are encoded in UTF-8. Only binary data escapes 
this transformation. Word does notread this encoding of RTF.

Exchange (Used in RTF ↔ HTML Conversions)

Control wordMeaning
\*\htmltagNIndicates that the destination is encapsulated HTML text (to be ignored by RTF readers, but used 
during reverse RTF->HTML conversion). This keyword is followed by a numeric parameter 
containing encapsulation flags.
\htmlrtfNToggling keyword to mark pieces of RTF to be ignored during reverse RTF->HTML conversion. N 
missing or N = 1 turns effect on;N =0 turns it off.
\*\mhtmltagNIndicates that the destination is an encapsulated tag with rewritten URLlinks that should be used 
in a conversion to plain HTML. Typically, URL links are rewritten as automatically generated 
MHTML reference names or as absolute external links. The keyword is followed by the flag 
parameter (the same one as for the \htmltagNkeyword).
\htmlbase Placeholder in front of encapsulated MHTML reference name that marks the place where the base 
URL should be appended. This keyword is only used inside the \mhtmltag destination.
