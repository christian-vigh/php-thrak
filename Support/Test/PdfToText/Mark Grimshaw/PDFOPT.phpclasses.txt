PDFOPT\_REPEAT\_SEPARATOR : Sometimes, groups of characters are separated by an integer value, which specifies the offset to subtract to the current position be-fore drawing the next group of characters. This quantity is expressed in many thou-sands of "text units". The PdfToText class considers that if this value is less than - 1000, then the string specified by the Separator property needs to be appended to the result before the next group of characters. If this flag is specified, then the Separator string will be appended (offset % 1000) times.  Kallionpää
